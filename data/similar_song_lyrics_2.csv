Bubble Music,Cam'ron,"28 ContributorsBubble Music Lyrics[Intro]
But I still get in trouble
Killa, uh
But what? Uh

[Verse 1]
Mami all on me 'cause I'm touching her belly (Belly)
I'm on butter Pirellis ('Rellis)
Whip purple and yellow, hello, that's butter and jelly (Chi-ching)
I flip butter on cellies all right in front of the deli (Who?)
Holly, Lilly to Kelly all spent ones on the telly (And what else?)
And I got hella gear (Gear)
My earring is nice, the price (What?), three town homes in Delaware (What else?)
Uh, tomato Porsche lookin' like tomato sauce (Yeah)
Hip hop hooray, I got to get that yayo off (Real rap)
That's blocks to the ave, cops come blockin' the ave
I put the Glock in the stash, slabs and tops in the trash (I push work)
Still stop and I laugh, ma, get them rocks in your ass
The rest? Twat and your bag, dag, hop in a cab (Cab)
Play you, for what? You gon' play yourself
Ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself (Uh-huh)
And my way to the wealth was SK, AK
Mayday, payday, dog, don't play with your health

[Chorus]
Mami, she open, she open
(Jump off?), hopin', I'm hopin'
(Grab her), rope 'em and dope 'em
(Oral), choke 'em and choke 'em
I flip bundle to bundle
Tryna double my double
At the same time (At the same time, music, I bubble, but what?)
But the cops say I'm (Looking for trouble)


[Verse 2]
I get fresh from Yankee Stadium to the Garden, I beg your pardon (I beg your pardon?)
Stop it, my closet, Macy's men's department
Pants, shirts, scarf, phone if you checkin' (Phone me up)
Get the scoop on the cologne, belt, and shoe section (Uh-huh)
Fur for fur, baby, baby, you'll go stir crazy (Stir crazy)
Got that David Yurman burnin', the bird gazy (Gazy)
You'll get hurt, play me, burp, let the dirt chase me
Every third lady that flirt want my chirp lately
I know some RNs that still strip
On I and this real dick
In the clinic, nurse suit and heels, shit (Go to work)
Better than college, after that, a student's home (Student's home)
At least after your bid, ain't no student loans (Nope)
To pay back, jack, ask what do you condone?
In towns with coke, the forty-five, a bluest chrome (Blue steel)
They done juiced my dome, knock knock, are you at home?
I'm Macaulay, girls call the crib and ask, ""Are you alone?"" Killa

[Chorus]
Mami, she open, she open
(Jump off?), hopin', I'm hopin'
(Grab her), rope 'em and dope 'em
(Oral), choke 'em and choke 'em
I flip bundle to bundle
Tryna double my double
At the same time (At the same time, music, I bubble)
But the cops say I'm (Looking for trouble)


[Verse 3]
Uh, we race foreign cars, custom models, drop-top, mustard Tahoe (Mustard Tahoe)
We like the musketeers (Yeah), trained by Cus D'amato (What else?)
Just the motto, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow (Tough to swallow)
Watch Sanford and Son (Who are you?), I'm like the buzz in Rollo (Rollo)
Fortunado, the Porsche Apollo, whores'll follow (What else?)
Got the MAC, jack, still swing swords like Zorro (Zorro)
We jackin' and clappin', y'all just applaud like bravo (Bravo)
Now applaud the capo (Capo), Zeek and Santana (Uh-huh)
I don't raise her wrists (Wrists), I keep eighths of piff
The game's a chick, I'm Kobe, I'ma rape the bitch (Rape the bitch)
Razor grips, laser spit
Glock cocked, J or fifth?
D on the block just like Jadakiss
Haters shift, plead the Fifth, spray the fifth
Gator kicks, Matrix, major chips
I'm your favorite, Killa (Dipset)

[Chorus]
Mami, she open, she open
(Jump off?), hopin', I'm hopin'
(Grab her), rope 'em and dope 'em
(Oral), choke 'em and choke 'em
I flip bundle to bundle
Tryna double my double
At the same time (At the same time, music, I bubble)
But the cops say I'm (Looking for trouble)",Killa Cam,Cam'ron

Get down (Uh-huh)
They never said we couldn't get down (Killa)
Long as we added in the fun sometime (They never said we couldn't get down)
It's like I'm psychic and shit
Get down (I called this shit about five years ago)
They never said we couldn't get down
Long as we added in the fun sometime (Dipset, all day, every day, man)
Santana, Jim Jones
Freekey be home '07, uh
Let's go

[Verse: Cam'ron]
Remember? I'm a man to respect (Remember?)
Remember? Santana was next (Now what?)
Now it's not TECs, it's checks and fans he collects (What I want?)
I want his wrist, fist, whole hand jammed with baguettes (Ow)
Pose for the camera, man (Man), me and Santana, man (Uh-huh)
Word to my grandma, ""He one bad mama jama, damn"" (Damn)
So I don't write for the stardom (Nope)
I get, booted, zooted (Uh-huh), write down my problems (Why?)
I've been through it, headed right for the bottom
D.C., nah, would've been a sniper in Harlem (So what?)
That's why I throw some dough to my co-D from Kos-tovo
Help me get on overflow (Shh), no one supposed to know
But she lay me up like the prime minister (Uh-huh)
Thousand grams of dope, smellin' like Heinz vinegar (Damn)
That was a lot to linger (But what?), but to the top, I bring her (What happened?)
When it came to dope (What?), I always copped in fingers (Uh)
Money missin', oh, shit, I almost chopped some fingers
Slit some wrists, that's when they said, ""Oh, shit, he's not a singer"" (Oh, he don't just rap)
Fuck the rap, fuck the movies, fuck Siskel and Ebert
This pistol, I squeeze it, missiles if needed, Killa
Remember? I'ma spend my cake, remember? (Remember?)
Jim? We gettin' out of 5H? (Projects)
Now chefs'll fry us steaks (That's true), it's a higher stake (That's true)
Swiss accounts, I'ma show you how to wire cake (Ow)
And we from BBO (Where else?), now you a CEO
Director, VEO, your own album, here we go (Go)
That's my man, anytime I holla, holla with me (Yup)
We shared chicken sandwiches, they was a dollar-fifty (Fifty)
Budget seven dollars, nickel bag and White Owl (We were fucked up)
And hope the chicken sandwich last us through the night, child
We ain't care, we ain't sleep, we was night owls (Owls)
Insomniatics, our lifestyles compatible
Magical, pops gone (Gone), shit tragical
Moms won't miss you, my house is where the addicts chill
I'm like a teacher (Uh-huh), I need me a sabbatical (What's that?)
It's not irrational (That what?), I grew up radical (So what?)
And you all are shook (Uh-huh), I bought all my crooks
Fuck you R&B niggas, Zeke sing all the hooks (C'mon)
Tito and Brick, yes, yes, come again (Damn)
They came sun or rain when I had that stomach pain

Yo, my homie Cash, well he gone for five
Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
'Cause, we live life to the fullest
300 and 65 nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Now, Uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, the morning's much colder
I seen summers get cold
And playa's do it up until the point and that they done and they fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frost-bitten, up North sitting, just like some effin' lost kittens
They getting locked up for carrying boy
They doing time up in Marion, boy, uh
I respect you
You do your time like Gotti and come home like that Marion boy
Dipset, holla

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
It's Santana, get ready
December
Woah, messin' with the gangstas, riders, uh uh
Y'all messin with some gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Y'all still want beef? Then holla
You think you 'bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
Young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons
Cocaine lessons to supply the towers, I had
'Fore they crashed and divide the Towers
I'm hurtin', working hard to reprovide the towers
Told you, you messin' with a gangsta boy
You messin with some gangstas, boy, don't do that
You got coke? Don't move that
These blocks belong to us, homie – remember I told you that
As for your boys, it's no more messages
If I see 'em pumping, I'm steppin' in my weapons and
I'm shooting off to the death of 'em
If he try to run shots ahead of him, he's already done and tell 'em (Tell 'em)
Welcome to New York City (Uh ohh)
No, welcome to Dipset City (Holla)
And thanks to Cam, I'm Harlem's new anchorman
Yes, chump, you should shake my hand
'Cause the Coupe gon' make me too cocky
And I'm not gon' wanna talk to you dudes who move sloppy
So move, watch me – stand still, don't move, watch me
I'ma show you how to do this, yeah

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
I'ma break it down real quick, yo
Ayo, look, dawg, I bought villas, stayed in resorts, scrilla
How extort Killa? I extort killas
Man, I caught killas; disarmed, fought killas
Cat frontin'? Pop-pop, poor killas
Who more realer? Weed in the four wheeler
Eff Mike, 'til you see me, you never saw 'Thriller'
Fishscale, fishscale, gorillas
Dirty whore want me to go–raw will ya'?
Smart Pisces, fresh from the Archdiocese
You got heart, fight me, I dearly depart wifey
I'm Anfernee, I do things the harder way
Pardon me, Escalade, marmalade, mama stayed
And I send her where stars'll play
And I do cop a car today, color pink Chardonnay
And I clap at ya' man
Got the clappers, ""clap on, clap off,"" clap at his hands
Only thing he ever clapped was his hands
He'll get butt-raped, duct-taped, the Michelin man, bastard
Get in this van, listen to Cam, maggot
Get in this van, listen to Cam, maggot
Listen, let's bring it back, you know why?
'Cause, this is the year when cats get shipped in the van
Vision's my scam, listen to man, listen
I miss the era of the BM's, BB's
I was ducking GMDC
Had that scope – aim and I light ya'
Seen all islands, Caymans to Rikers
Contain, detain, maintain, complain the stay [?] reign, the game is for lifers
I don't care, I put flame in the fire
Christian, atheist, you pray to Elijah
Don't play, okay? Just pray I don't snipe ya
'Cause with the SK, doggy, I'm OK
My AK was my A.K.A., before my ABC's had me A-OK
I'll show you how to make 2 million out ya deal

What did I do... to make your life so sad?

We all rise and fall, some never recover
Others dream of supremecy, living with they mother
Like infancy, you too weak to stand on your own
And worse when you see me with something you moan, childish ways
I'm at the game, you playin' [?] all day with old words like ""crime don't pay""
You ain't a dealer, you a fuck up buyin' doubles gettin high all day
You sell drugs to do drugs, hustelin' backwards
I'll outhustle you backwards
Pardon my back, motherfucka I'm crushing you backwards ass nigga
With cracks in your ass, no cash in your stash
Tell 'em why you so mad this way I'll understand your frustration
You ice grill and I'm icy, dispite your feelings
Chillin', cause real recognize real and

Ain't doing dues, you assume I'm livin' better than you
I am but that's my damn business
Hatin', cause you broke and I'm tryna make it
Cause you buy dimes and I buy diamond bracelets
You hustle all day, put some money away
And when you see me don't say shit to me okay?
Givin' me fake hugs, animosity showin'
Givin' fake love, as if I didn't notice
What if I didn't rap?
That little money you make, would you be gettin' that?
Picture that
You know my sons kidnap, hustle and spit MACs
It's a struggle for my niggas
Fuck you if you ain't with us

Streets are infested with people who would squeal on me
You will see the message I deliver to you lyrically
I got this locked like penitentiaries, too sweet on the [M?] I see

Get a feel like you sitting in first class, relax

As long as the earth spins, and you'll get seasick
And my waves be thick enough for them Cali dudes to surf in, cowabunga!
Your low riding denims look like midgets is hiding in them
They say I like it from the front, they like it from the back
But when the kids is sliding in them, they be screaming (Damn)

And um I'm not bragging

In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots
With princess cut canaries the size of lemon cough drops

Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)

Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow Azure (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The princesses in my ear, are clear and cut right
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get at hoes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin dough

Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
In Akademik sample velours
Hypnotic samples to pour
The European sample Azure
Wheel on the right side 'B' with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep tefs jammed in the four
Amp weed to draw, end up in a wheelchair ramp by your door

After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is cause I got the same Nikes that Jordan had on in ""Space Jam""


[Verse 10: Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

[Verse 11: Fabolous]
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior

Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?)
Why wouldn't I huh? Why wouldn't I what?",Forgive Me Father,Fabolous

Yeahhhhh
Uh
Yeah, I like the way (Yeah) that sound
Uh-uh, n-n, (Yeah) n-now
Check

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Nigga, you feelin' like a frog? Then jump
One leap will bring you from bar to the trunk
From the trunk to the dump
I'ma rain on 'em, put the chump on a slope
Like a rib shot, that's what the customers want
Don't cha? This ain't the typical story
Therefore, I don't fall in the category
I'm cool, calm and collective
Yukon or tha Lexus, blue chronic for breakfast to match with the necklace
Dimes hold me down, so the rats wanna check this
Reckless, born treacherous, sworn specialist
Especially, if you rest next to me
Nigga come testin' me, you get the gun recipe (Pop)
These old niggas want the new boy sound
Actin' like they don't know who holdin' New York down
Yeah I used to buy Nic's
Ten years later, now I'm superfly slick
Without a roof on my whip, shit
I sip a hundred-proof 'til I'm ripped
And wave at the haters who got a root canal sick
Tough niggas like to make a scene so the llama's close
That kind of shit don't fly like mamma jokes
We got 'em long, short, all kinda toast
Boy, I done left shit trails all around the coast
To places you get around by boat, I get a pound, I smoke
I put it down, I'm dope
I'm on scope when I pass the block
I make traffic stop, a product of everything that made the apple rot
This apple jacks, be long before the platinum plaques
The pro tools and the wax
Take a step back 'fore you catch a contact
The flow's like an M16 with an arm-strap
I'ma bomb on niggas until they can't bomb back
The Hiroshima demeaner, microphone crack


[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
A lot of shit changed since I came
Y'all came round here, fuckin' up the game
Therefore I ain't servin' nothin', but the pain
You playin', I'm hungry than a mothafucka, mayn
Rob a store before you walk around poor
'Cause you ain't gettin' nothin' from me, you grown boy
You fuelin' up my fire when you hate
So I'ma lean on ya 'til you make a mistake (I can't wait)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Until the curtains close
It's just me, the tooly an' them purple O's
Endo overload, drive like I own the roads
These niggas is pus', that's why my shoulders cold
Mac by the toted bow, I'm ridin' filthy in the Beamer'
'Cause I can have Limina Calina bring to a misdemeanour
You drown in deep water, any nigga around come form the street corner
Where you need your heat on ya
I'm on recline while my next CD climbs
Southside, Greedy Dine, red wine, DB9, NYPD grind
Why, it ain't an easy grind
A nigga try to get mine, I'ma feed him nine
And it's graffiti time, niggas sprayin' ya mural
For tryna be a motherfuckin' hero
I'm fresh, fly and flashy, best guy, if you ask me
Jet by on 'em nasty, nigga you in a taxi (I can't wait)


[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
A lot of shit changed since I came
Y'all came round here, fuckin' up the game
Therefore I ain't servin' nothin', but the pain
You playin', I'm hungry than a mothafucka, mayn
Rob a store before you walk around poor
'Cause you ain't gettin' nothin' from me, you grown boy
You fuelin' up my fire when you hate
So I'ma lean on ya 'til you make a mistake (I can't wait)

New York get the Bloody Money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stash
You monkey walk, I'm hunchback, sneak quiet
Talk about me, gossip, scared to death when I pop up
[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
I'm fouler than gats that don't bust when they supposed to
Been around you, play close, but wasn't close to you
The setup was weak, you coming
I saw you cuttin' corners, snake-type shit
Tie you up, seal your lip, wrist bleeding
Cowboy rope, choke your throat
Put the bogey out in your face
Now your face laced like ash tray face
Stay with gat on my waist
Give the god some space, shoot you up above waist
If I ain't got beef right here or right there
Ice-grill stare, shoulda set it off right there
CNN war report, spread across New York
Guard him Indian style - knees bent, militant
Yo the world know Noreaga from Iraq
Beef with me serious, keep it real, that's that
Get stabbed in your back, my man Alley Cat
Little cousin from Jamaica, brown-skin thug
Thug blood, yo we stuck in the game like it's a drug
My pops was a thug nigga, was on the streets too
Uncle Wise did biz since '82
Back on the streets, A hundred seven Guy Brew
I see you, come see you, writing scrolls (writing scrolls)
To the rest of the fam, locked in holes
At age eight, money come first, snatch purse
Go to church, yo that's not me, mami I'm cursed
Iblis glamorous, diabolic, devilish
This game real, realer than you think, just think
Spots get rushed, knots get touched, police busts
Yo what happened? Police kicked door, yo he was rappin'
Your wife - what what! What what! Dressed indecent
A hundred crackers, son it's the one-ten precinct


[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
New York get the Bloody Money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stash
You monkey walk, I'm hunchback, sneak quiet
Talk about me, gossip, scared to death when I pop up

[Verse 2 : N.O.R.E.]
Yo, time zone, cabron, maricon
Bitches callin me up, tryin to set me up
Like Amina and Gina, kid they from Medina
Emanuel, keep fish scale to sell
General - clique deep with cartel
When niggas get locked, who you think they call for bail?
Shorty legs mad smooth, son, I'm left struck
Pussy plus dick could only equal a fuck
Fatty bangin', she analyze, my chain hangin'
We waitin, conversatin', Iblis Satan
Illegal life, watch police on bikes
Like Steel and Shame, they monkey wrenched the whole game
Stressed day, police watch from 12K
While I smoked shorty sipped Chardonnay
I lay - lay back, cognac
And I don't even drink like that, I sell crack
Yo my ices gleam, type mean, sell to fiends
Shoot guns, parallel
Pistol bust well
Kid whatever, desert storm like bad weather
Clique together, keep gats under the leather
You lightweight, what? I'm heavyweight hold weight
Yo it's jail niggas comin' home taking a shit
Yo illegal business, them niggas got dealt wit
Got smoked
God body cat, he sniff coke
Yo he's old time, thinkin 'bout drinkin' his wine
Regulatin' 9-9, get my crew out, survive shootout
Tactics, keep gats under the mattress
Player hater - my team a bunch of regulator
Set you up, you won't make it to the elevator
You never been to jail, I'm jail seen
Niggas seen me in jail since thirteen
Shooting up scenes
Real niggas take cream


[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
New York get the Bloody Money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stash
You monkey walk, I'm hunchback, sneak quiet
Talk about me, gossip, scared to death when I pop up

The hood know what it is they know who I am
And they don't care what I scan but they know I'm the man
Know I could bring 'em to the spot show them the grams
Or I could bring 'em to the garage and show them the lam
Know that I could show 'em the Range and show 'em the Beemer
And I could lift up my shirt and show them the steamer
Had ups and downs but I stil get along with 'em
Nobody hatin cause I ain't get on a song wit 'em
Yeah and I ain't out there pumpin
But I might slide through and give the crackheads somethin
Not only on my off time I be in the studio
Usually though probably hit the block by my 4th rhyme
Think wit a boss mind lot of evil thoughts run across mine
I sell it if I could get it off fine and you already know I'm real
When it comes to the game and the hood you know how I feel... What

Besides that I'm from a coast where ya bitch ass could be gone In 30 seconds
Dickie this dickie that you in perry ellis
California sunshine compliment the heavy carrots
If it's beef three words 1,8,7
Niggas get popped and start singing like Faith Evans
Niggas know I got a gift they must hate presents
Spray up everything look like the case spelling
Had to settle for the d cause we hate failing
Hit after hit I'm like the hip-hop Hank Aaron
I'm in the BX riding with cali On the ds
Doing drivebys off the T-Rex
Got love on the west and the es
We don't play games guns stashed in the ps
And ps y'all niggas is bs
We kick swing and take shots at you like it's recess

I'm talking 'bout this Ruff Ryder lifestyle in every single state
You feeling lucky roll the dice who got the bank stop it
Throw'em in the bathroom he getting outta pocket
Mock it, chop it, do what you will
I just wanna see your mans' face in the street when his blood spill
Man made the money money never made the man
That's why you'll never see security where I stand
And we stil tryin to eat
You poppin shit from your hotel with federallies In your suite
Two shots of patrone, then I run up in your home
Cut the wire to your phone, strangle you then I'm gone

Now I'm Ryding and Dying it's Ruff Ryders new recruit
And do remember we ain't all about the music duke
Cause every member of my family got a screw that's loose
And when it's drama all we do is shoot with guns so big
They put a hole through you the size of a hoola - hoop
Believe you me the streets do see
That lyrically I'm in a zone like a 3 2 D
If I ain't DWI-ing up the BQE
I'm blowin some boon with Toon in a 323

Yeah, I'm fuckin' with this
It's that classic shit, that gangsta shit, yeah

[Chorus]
Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin' what if?
Homie I play the block tryin' to get my packs off - sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?

[Verse 1]
If I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy
Niggas in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
Niggas would think I bump my fuckin' head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady
If I put out bullshit joints like AZ
Every chance niggas get, they'd try and play me
But I move around with a little .380
A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
Niggas'll say ""50 that ain't gangsta, fuck ya""
Man I'ma just keep doin' what I do
Cause niggas can't do me, better than I do, ha ha

Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?

What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?
And all the backpack niggas loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin' so cool
What if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homie 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
Shit I'd give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap nigga you didn't know
You'd be sayin' ""Damn that kid got a sick flow""
What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin' Curtis Mayfield or Marvin, somethin' smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha ha

[Chorus]
Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?

'Cause if
You got grams and I got grams, let's put our
Grams together and lock these grams
If we can't eat together, then you ain't my man
So when you see me in thе streets, don't shake my hand, if
You got guns and I got guns, let's put our
Guns togethеr and lock this, son
You don't want to roll with me I'mma pop you, son
If you ain't with me, you against me, I don't bite my tongue
I get it gully, bet you like that, huh
Where the weed, nigga light that up
Ayo, I fight the night shifts 'till I knock out mornings
Used to jump crackheads when the block got boring
Come to your hood and make it hot, 'cause I got mine scorching
I walk around with no ID, I got warrants
The cab driver dropped me off, with my mouth yawnin'
He said the cab was seven dollars, but I hopped out on him
Tried to ask me for his bread, so I wild' out on him
'Caught him with a two-piece, left him knocked out snorin'
Niggas takin' this for granted, we want in
He don't want to make enemies, he want friends
Put the gun in his mouth, yeah it's me again
Leave your tongue hangin' out like beat up Timbs
What type of situation did you leave us in?
If you can't write fire, give me your pen
You come from a hood, that we re-up in
BK, that's the borough niggas G'd up in
You better watch, how you pull your V up, slim
Keep the window low enough, so I can see your chin
Who the fuck hood you think your tryin' to creep up in?
If the glass low enough to stick the Nina in
I'mma throw the drop on you and your three-butt-mens
If you ain't creepin' on me, keep your seat up then
Why you keep actin' like you got the brains of prophet?
Pluck y'all niggas and rip you lames out the socket
Lil nigga, you a faggot who came out the closet
Hold you by your ankles and shake your change out your pockets
Got the Heckler & Koch, I ain't even got to cock it, it's double action
Pop you, I pull it out and then lock it
The streets is mine, the bars is mine, give it back
Papoose, I'm the new era like a fitted cap
Rappers ain't the same when you see 'em in person
Some of them act tough 'till you murk 'em
Son know he can't come in my hood, 'cause I'mma hurt him
I stop son from comin' in like curtains
I mastered this, so I spit at you wisely
I'm your master, like your original copy
If I die tryin', I'mma be rich in the afterlife then
At the crossroads to the riches with lavish items
A lot of rappers sellin' their souls, I'd rather price 'em
So pass the scalpel, his Adam's apple, I'll have to slice 'em
You savage triflin' and backwards bitin', dumb acting spiting
My raps enticing, so for my borough I sacrifice 'em
I stab 'em twice and my dagger dice 'em, now that's excitement
They flashin' sirens, they passin' indictments as fast as lightning
Beat you up with my bare hands, you faggots frightened
What did he use to put the beats on 'em? Is that a trident?

'Cause when the block start clickin'

Hustlers who hustlin', gun busters who squeezin'
Gangstas who eatin, thieves who sneak thievin'
If you still breathin' I like to welcome you
To section 190.05 ""Grand Jury Proceedings""
You broke the law allegedly, and you caught a case
You sittin' in the cell with your hands on your face
The District Attorney they gotta get an indictment
So they take the case to the grand jury, you not invited
Now you could let the D.A. go and choose you fate
Or you could go to the grand jury and plead your case
No less than 16 people, no more than 23
A panel by Superior Court, understand me
Gotta look 'em in they eyes as simple as can be
Make 'em believe you innocent, you could be free
But you there's always a flip side to every coin
The judge, the legal aide, D.A. they all joined
And if you get indicted keep your memory foul
Cause you gotta tell the same story when you go to trial
Adolescents, adults, and juveniles
I hope jotting this down
If you locked up for more than 120 hours man just wait
Cause without the disposition of a felony complaint
Or commissment of a hearing they gotta open they gate
And give you a R&R, that's your 180.80 date
This is just a briefing of the knowledge I process
In the belly of the beast they put you to the test

Eyes all chinky
She be comin' through in the new Cadillac Escalade on Twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill' in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealin' bags
And you know your man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chicken heads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? She a hella one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Emilio Pucci
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain, I just let her give me knowledge

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl

With the see-through roof, oof
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride with me
She take over the wheel every time I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Wakin' up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon' hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Hermes shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game 'cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the Jag'
She goin' shoppin', need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
'Cause (I don't want no nasty girl)

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
She's a good, good, good, good girl

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She don't play no games, I love her for that
Or hang with no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like makin' love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world
And I don't want no nasty girl

How long we gon' have this shit on lock, man?
Huh, yes, sir
You gave me the right track, Kanye
Listen

[Verse 1]
I been coppin' them P's and maybe that's part of the reason (Maybe)
Feel like a boxer bobbin' and weavin'
But I'm gettin' head, she bobbin' her weave and I'm (Yes, sir)
Grabbin' her neck to stop her from breathin'
I'ma wild out 'til I part with my breathin'
'Til I'm sparked up and leakin' (Leakin'), part of the cement (Uh)
I need somethin' pure like from the Garden of Eden (Why?)
Wouldn't mind makin' her a part of my achievements (What happened?)
'Cause when music discouraged my pride (Who was there?)
Zeke the only one with courage to ride (Uh)
The ride so dirty inside, seem like we were playin' in mud
Hazin' it up, grams, gauge, and a snub
Who ill? A check for two mil'
And a cheap case, deface blue steel, true skills
I got stories that my soul could sing
Flip water like Poland Spring and I'ma hold them things

But fuck it, who ever thought I would rock at the Roc? (Killa)
Top of top on top of the top
But, yo, nothing definite, I chop up the rocks
And I stop up the drop, blocka-blocka the block
Hello, mate, yellow tape, helicopter your spot (Spot)
What you wanted is not what you got
And I pop up them cops, 'cause, dog, it ain't about Cam (It ain't about me)
I got a son, homeboy, it's about Cam (For that?)
It's about bein' 'bout it, if not, you're ass-backwards
My mathematics, 'cause cash matters (That's important)
Little niggas need to sit up and breathe (Breathe)
If the town too hot, get up and leave (Be smart)

Let me see you through this
Killa, Jones, Freekey
Yeah man, I'm back at it, come on

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm ""Gone til' November"" (Yeah)
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up (Of course)
Call my bird, get my broad, have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggas, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please, yeah)
I see a town I'm liking
See some niggas getting money in a town: I like it (Yeahhh)
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like, ""It's my block now, alright, kid?"" (Whoa)
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out
And rang out the side of his right ear (Woo!)
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that Pyrex Vision
Pot, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitching (What)
Yeah, I'm sorry, but this is how I'm living
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!


[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone, watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home, hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (Say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching 'Shaft', clocking math

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high; will I survive?
In the city where the skinny niggas die
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year, so, okay, okay, okay
Y'all can't fuck with me – no way, José, or Héctor Camacho
TEC blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker, I'm the best, I told y'all before
I showed y'all before, ay!

I'm on the west side of Chicago, looking for a bust-down
Don't make me put my two arms up, touchdown! (What up, ma?)
You stay in touch now, but when I touch down
I'm like Buckshot, shorty, Duck Down
Yeah, I must clown, I'm from Harlem, Uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, ""What now?""
Birds flip a dozen, chicks, it's dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, Toya's kissing muffin
Worse than that, they go home and kiss they husband (Shit's foul)
The shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons bugging
This on my wrist is nothing
Yeah, it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhyming
You fucking with Pablo, bravo

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Fuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know: if it's furnished I'ma take it
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money, then you rubbing the spot
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon, smoking and drinking
Nigga, is you thinking that our fate is violent?
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
And if you facing Capital Pun, pass me a gun
And I'ma give you time to run, while I rapidly peel, uh

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it


[Verse 2: Jadakiss & Styles P]
I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case, who's the loser?
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze, plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares?)
Talking 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
Gun work's official, but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame
We Soul For Real in the hood, we make ""Candy Rain""
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel, I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Jada-MWAH, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean
(He be aight though) You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in Intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky, 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid, so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest, either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell

And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean, I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

Sins of a father make your life ten times harder

Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach you good values so you cherish it
Took me twenty-six years to find my path
My only job is cut the time in half
So at thirteen, we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
'Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

And the night falls

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving ""Shorty, hi""
You know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out? She dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce, she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle, meanwhile
She out doing the same thing, now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

How you a man, waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on

[Chorus: Kanye West, Nas & Chrisette Michele]
Some people really (So keep dreamin')
Some people really, some people really are (Still dreamin')
Still dreamin' (Wha-wha-wha-wha-one-two, one two)

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask you
""Who in need of Cash Rule, who could blast tools?""
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew, she worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it
So she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting, and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by, she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of newscasting
To a world of entrapment – a good girl gone backwards

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized

And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died, uh
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all Black, uh, I love us

So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor

I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else

Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholesaler (Hey)
I think it's good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yuugh)
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us (Woo)
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four-door (Woo)

'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston

Nah, man, mad people was frontin'
Aw, man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 3-1-2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
Forty killings in a weekend, forty killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chain?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
""I'm on fire, ayy,"" that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

Cops Shot The Kid,Nas,"122 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsCops Shot the Kid Lyrics[Intro: Richard Pryor]
The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
""Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!""
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, ""Ree, put your hands up, black boy!""

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

[Verse 1: Nas]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels


[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests


[Chorus: Slick Rick & Kanye West]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (Workin' nine-to-five)

[Intro: Betty Wright]
There's a field with angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be, His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, all I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Rick Ross]
Niggas be lovin' the old Ye
They sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali
You can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Hunt)
People sayin', ""Ye, we need another Yeezus"" (Hunt)
Lames try to tell me, ""Cut the wildin' out, out""
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive
Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!?


[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address
Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress
Fellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you the best
Major cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh
Soldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet, the Navy
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me ""That was just some foul shit""
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence

I can feel his blessings wash away my sins

Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't askin' them for nothing

Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes, I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out

I Don't Know What To Tell You,Redrama,"9 ContributorsI Don’t Know What To Tell You LyricsThis song was recorded in 2005 as a single to Redrama’s second studio album ‘Street Music’. ‘I Don’t Know What To Tell You’ was also featured in an NBA Live 07 Soundtrack.[Hook: Redrama]

Now I'm the first to admit the fact
I've done a little bit of this and that
Just wanna spit my raps, my life ain't yo' concern
I ain't gone carry the weight of the world
And I don't know what to tell you
I've been to Heaven but I've tasted Hell, too
Face the Devil, don't give a fuck
Smack him in his face, kick him inna nuts

[Verse 1: Redrama]

They say I talk a lot
I walk a block with both feet broke
The storm a rock, but ain't sinking Red's boat
I see the coast, but I'm too blurry-eyed to see hope
Inna chokehold
Trying to hold on these ropes
I've done less wrong than I've done right
But I can never escape what I've done right
Thinking Lucifer live on Jupiter, he chilling right here
But I'm killing this nightmare
Not willing to fight fair
Hell with a Nike Air, I run barefoot through the desert
Make the whole damned world follow my neck jerk
Laying it brick by brick
The kid don't quit until he got a pyramid
Now I'm a stand tall inna Land of the Lost
You just got laid off? we gone handle yo' boss
So get yo' hands where my eyes can see 'em
If you's a human being


[Hook]

[Verse 2: Redrama]

I left my ex-girl in Hell hurt, wasn't there for her
Was an expert in putting Red first, though I care for her
Now I'm a broken man
My life slipping away although I'm holding on with both hands
For some folks it's dope, I need liquor to calm me
Drink 'til I'm a zombie
Helsinki ain't no palm trees
Looking back I understand the man I should have been
But thing is that I truly am haunted by the boogeyman
I took a stand long time ago, I treat people how I want 'em to treat me
But shit ain't easy
When he keeps calling it's hard not to answer
My number changing like Pampers
But it don't matter
Is it a bad world or a bad God?
Am I a bad man having a bad day, or bad odds?
Too many damned scars, trying to patch 'em up
I don't really do it no more but pass the blunt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Redrama]


Don't you know what you listening to
A God damned white man singing the blues
Take a good look cause I'm the living proof
Trying to walk the narrow road in these shitty ass shoes
Now you know what you listening to
A God damned white man singing the blues
Take a good look cause I'm the living proof
Trying to walk the narrow road in these shitty ass shoes
I was losing my last bit of faith
My way out wasn't the door but the windowpane
Only thing I had in my life's liquor and misery
And the only thing I could write was my obituary
This my way a telling my brothers that I appreciate
How they kept my vision straight
Reason that I live today
I miss 'em days when we would just sit and blaze
Talking 'bout which a them chicks got big tits and things
But things change
And I ain't gonna be bitter man
Cause I know that love always wins the hate
Let your fists swing where my eyes can see 'em

Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Do what you thinkin' so, I tried to let you go
Turn up a blink of light and then I swang it slower
A nigga upset for sure 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drinkin' drough

So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rear view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin'
'Cause they denyin' is racial profilin'

Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

And been a baller that I am I talk to them
Givin' a damn 'about not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'm a laugh at you and then I'm a have to cruise
I'm in number two on some more DJ Screw
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tellin' them ""We hate you!""

I can't be toss or tell 'em that they should've known
Tippin' down I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'm about to pull up at your home, it's on

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Prayin For Help,T.I.,"12 ContributorsPrayin for Help Lyrics[T.I. praying over indistinct chatter]
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespassed against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
For ever and ever, hmm, amen

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I knelt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you wanna condemn
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' against them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Than you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you wanna
Compare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help


[Hook]
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man
Man, I'm prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else could see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me
They got me prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone, with no kinda support
While I was prayin' for help
Realized that I don't need nobody else
If God wit' me I can do it myself
I'm tired of just prayin' for help

[Verse 2]
I know it's only one king, one thing, one being
Only somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith
I pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day, that I'mma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight
I'mma be defending my strife
'Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never gon' quit
No matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever gon' spit, harder than niggas hatin' on Tip
You can take away, place it on Tip, I double my load
Carry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours
And I betta don't fold, put that on my soul
If it takes till I'm a hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals


[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ay it's so many times, I done wish I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed
With so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans
With so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggas in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests
So many haters love seeing you stress, but tribulations come with being the best
Still it's so many who flex, singin' bout checks, when they greener than Shreks
Sellin' dreams, never seen in the jects, that's why I'm seen as a threat
So many stripes off the streets I'mma vet, so many rappers get so little respect
Now niggas faith on the shelf, cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the heart that a nigga that dealt, so many niggas done left outta the hood
Made a way for themself, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self
So many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self
The ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help

Why U Mad At Me,T.I.,"16 ContributorsWhy U Mad At Me? Lyrics[Intro]
I got a question fo' you hatin ass niggas out there (Ay, ay)
Why you mad at me? Ay
Oh lame ass nigga (Why you mad at me?)
Sucka ass nigga (Why you mad at me?)

[Verse 1]
Remember late nights earn stripes serving straight white
Talk shit slapbox clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the J need 'fore the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Before a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga 'fore you blink twice
They right. I'm reciting my life
Nigga I was there no matter what: through sirens, on a silent night
Cold Sundays, slow Mondays, hot Friday nights
Tuesday, Thursdays, serving whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days, hostile evenings, even violent nights
Chip on my shoulder, hold a grudge -- cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggas have no idea what my life was like
Before the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[Hook]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top?(Why you mad at me?)
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop? (Why you mad at me?)
Is it cause I kept it pimping and stayed down? (Why you mad at me?)
Or is it cause I am the A-Town? (That's why you mad at me?)


Is cause you a lame and I'm a G? (Why you mad at me?)
Is it cause I got love in the streets? (Why you mad at me?)
Is cause you know your time running out? (That's why you mad at me?)
Is it cause you know I'm King of the South? (That's why you mad at me!)

[Verse 2]
Niggas mad cause I got it like this
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same Tip til the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
You question that or think other wise now you've offended me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggas in to me
Got little rap niggas likening to me
Major labels and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang, listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't picture me
Riding in a Phantom. Man I swear I never fathomed
All the fame that a nigga can gain from Atlanta
Now I'm just trying to maintain for Atlanta
Before niggas was saying Atlanta
I was Grove Park, Doug High -- I stayed in Atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in Atlanta
But what is that compared to contributions I made to Atlanta?


[Hook]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top?(Why you mad at me?)
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop? (Why you mad at me?)
Is it cause I kept it pimping and stayed down? (Why you mad at me?)
Or is it cause I am the A-Town? (That's why you mad at me?)

Is cause you a lame and I'm a G? (Why you mad at me?)
Is it cause I got love in the streets? (Why you mad at me?)
Is cause you know your time running out? (That's why you mad at me?)
Is it cause you know I'm King of the South? (That's why you mad at me!)

[Verse 3]
Ay pick a reason any reason all excuses'll do
But man you lucky I ain't bucking like I used to do fools
While you was throwing one's and two's
I was lifting up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around him cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowing he scared and tell him
""Give me they names or you doing the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said.""
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smelling. Blow? I ain't selling
Where you got that impression? Ain't no telling
Yes I'm a felon, why was that in question?
What about all these records I'm selling?
I'm Bankhead born and Bankhead bred
And when a nigga die I'm gone be Bankhead dead

Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top?(Why you mad at me?)
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop? (Why you mad at me?)
Is it cause I kept it pimping and stayed down? (Why you mad at me?)

Why We Die,Busta Rhymes,"16 ContributorsWhy We Die LyricsFun fact: Busta Rhymes, Jay Z, and DMX all attended the same high school. Busta and Jay even battled each other in the lunch room – Jay Z won.[Intro: DMX]
Ugh
This here some shit that—that—that niggas ain't even seen before
This that shit
Motherfuckers ain't never seen nothing like this before
For real, man
It's goin', down, baby
Ugh, ugh
Busta Rhymes
What!
Ugh
DMX, nigga
Ugh, ugh
Ugh, ugh, ugh

[Verse 1: DMX]
I see ghosts clearly, even though most don't hear me
They still wanna get near me (Ungh), fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feeling (What)
From the floor, to the ceilin', straight through the roof
Want the truth? I kinda miss robbin' and stealin' (C'mon!)
'Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved (Ugh)
I was ugly, so I robbed; no one loved me—shit was hard (C'mon!)
Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (Why?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit, then why should I try? (Unh!)
See, plenty niggas die over dumb shit up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good (Damn!)
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it wasn't enough (Uh-huh)
The Devil told me it would happen, but I kept callin' his bluff (Uh-huh)
When it rains, it pours; now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine—define revolvin' doors (Nigga!)


[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggas tell me (Why) tell me (We die)
'Cause we crazy with it (Hunh!), quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse
Let me ask my niggas (Why?)
My niggas, tell me (Why) tell me (We die)
Because we Gods nigga (And) we go the yard, nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet (Huh)
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggas (Why?)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ugh, yo, they say the good die young in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that: Why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, ask God, ""Love me, please""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggas that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They wanna slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart—
Shouldn't that count for somethin'?
I was told I'd amount to nothin' most of my childhood life
By folks that was stuntin' my growth
Separated me from the shit I was wantin' the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them O's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin' to erase my ghostses, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders
Tryin' to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words, nigga, my will was weak
Please feel what I speak
This ain't your average, ordinary, jargon, weak rap niggas be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, X, and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, 'til we meet, niggas


[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggas tell me (Why) tell me, ah! (We die)
'Cause we crazy with it (Hunh), quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse (Ah)
With all the agony expressed in this verse (Ha)
Let me ask my niggas (Why?)
My niggas tell me (Why) tell me, ah! (We die)
Because we Gods, nigga (And) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet (Huh! Ha!)
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggas (Why?)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
You must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See, you too could get it through your FUBU sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark
Trespassin' on a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for with every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke
It's like you inhale the demon in the gutter, stressed, struggled, and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow
I'd leave a treasure for my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin' in your steppin', faggot nigga 'cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm
In the name of reppin' real niggas in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin' me to rep for the better
And carry on something great and keep a nigga name livin' forever
Now tell me—


[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
'Cause we crazy with it (Hunh!), quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse
Let me ask my niggas (Why?)
My niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
Because we Gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga (Ha!)
Because I walk the ground under my feet (Hunh!)

Black Unicorn,2 Chainz,"44 ContributorsBlack Unicorn Lyrics[Verse 1: Sunni Patterson]
And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Or something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod, I recall
So many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said it, ""The best thing you can do and be is you""
""This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due""
Ain't that the truth? And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
'Cause there's a place where you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, 'cause love is all around

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate
Sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust
Turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade


[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really wanna be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need, you need
Freedom

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practiced repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze, Dad kept this in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this
Underscore, it's just me and dope
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me


[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really wanna be

I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need, you need

The Last Song,Yelawolf,"32 ContributorsTranslationsفارسیThe Last Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody's askin' me lately where I'm from
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done
But man, if I told you what I've seen and been through, then you probably run off
You're scared of the truth so instead in secret lined in chalk
See, I've been lost ever since I could walk
Looking for my daddy in anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of lookin' at me like a joke
Or leavin' me behind, leavin' me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around
And I didn't give a shit, 'cause me and my momma we held it down
No new kicks, first day of school I'm goodwill bound
But when you come from the trench, that's how you learn to walk around
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes, homie
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you, I got 'em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf turn the page

[Hook]
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show
In the magazines, hear me on the radio
So what do you think huh?
(I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down)
I'm sorry daddy, you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road, no time to say hello
Bye (And I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down)


[Verse 2]
Yeah, mamma you look great; perfect
Be safe on your first date, for certain
If he brings you home too late... I'll hurt him
Don't worry 'bout me I'm safe, I'll close the curtains
And I feel like I'm raisin' you but what do I know, baby blue
All I know is that I was made in you, so I put all my faith in you
Yeah, I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich, tear drops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole, young and dumb, smokin' weed
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me
But everything I did I had to see, feel the pain, had to grieve
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be
What I've learned cannot be taught, what I've earned cannot be bought
Justified, deserve it all, so don't be concerned, it's not your fault
I never counted sheep, I count my blessings
So if you see him now momma, don't give him the cold shoulder, just give him my message
Just tell him

[Hook]
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show

Got the Cris' and the ganja and it's gettin' her calmer

Just a steppin' stone for me, now I'm hittin Madonna
And she twistin' the fauna as we sit in the sauna

And your ass is fat and your head is right
And your dough is good, we can smash tonight
Right here in the car, ma, at the light
If you ask for cash, oh, I'm mad for life
Kiss ass, you dyke, and I'm fast to fight
If you get mad, clap or grab a bite (What?)

What influenced me (let em know)....it was the jewelry
Tryna get cash so I can do it like the older G's (BALLIIIING!)
The 80's...big thick rope chains
Life was all crazy getting rich off cocaine (TRUE STORY NIGGA)
So I been caught up dog, nothing like Usher (no).....
More like a hustler (yep)
All night with customers, tryna get my paper up (right)
Jealousy, envy....gotta watch, they'll spray you up
But it was something bout the gun play....
Rolling dice on blocks, double parked on a one way(TRIPS NIGGA!)
And breaking law was the norm' (yep), the club break about 4 in the morn'd
So we parking lot pimp, hit the diner for some grub
The squad type thick you know I'm rolling with the thugs

[Chorus: Max B & Jim Jones]
BYRD GANG WE GET MONEY....
WE WON'T STOP, WE DESTINED TO BLOW
I'mma TAKE MY NIGGAZ AND BITCHES WHEREVER I GOOOO
SO DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME, DON'T FORGET ABOUT MEEEE....
I KNOW I KNOOOOOOW


[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Now as I roll up my window (R-Class), blaze up the indo (that purple!)....
Get tore down for my homies in the pen (miss you Zeke)
I'm ma take you the Cali with me (WESTSIDE!)....
Know ya dress code, heavy sag on ya Dickies (B'S & C'S!)
If we out in Houston, the music-we can slow it up (slow motiooon)
And get screwed, get a deuce and we can pour it up!
ATL sure!, if you balling and you make it rain (BALLIIIING!)
""I'm in love with a stripper"", alcohol on ya brain
Fast track life, the shit is uncanny (I LOVE IT)
When it come to birds fly south to Miami (OPIUM!)
Weather like 80 (sunny), drop-top Mercedes (BALLIN)
""Sai Pa Say"", on the block in Little Haiti
Chicago is the Bulls, the Bears, and the gangsters (you hear that?)
2 12'N with the OG's, tryna get the answers
And all these O. T trips got me tired
Drive the wheels til they fall off
And I just bought some new tires

[Chorus: Max B & Jim Jones]
BYRD GANG WE GET MONEY....
WE WON'T STOP, WE DESTINED TO BLOW

We Gonna Make It,Jadakiss,"49 ContributorsWe Gonna Make It Lyrics[Produced by The Alchemist]

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Fuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know: if it's furnished I'ma take it
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money, then you rubbing the spot
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon, smoking and drinking
Nigga, is you thinking that our fate is violent?
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
And if you facing Capital Pun, pass me a gun
And I'ma give you time to run, while I rapidly peel, uh

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it


[Verse 2: Jadakiss & Styles P]
I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case, who's the loser?
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze, plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares?)
Talking 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
Gun work's official, but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame
We Soul For Real in the hood, we make ""Candy Rain""
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel, I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Jada-MWAH, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean
(He be aight though) You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in Intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky, 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid, so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest, either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell


[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

Hotter than even holdin' work at the Days Inn
With New York plates outside
Get up out of there, fuck the ride!

[Verse 8: The Notorious B.I.G & Jay-Z]
Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper (Uh)
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank White
Need the keys to your InnKeeper (That's right)
Chill, homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me
You're holdin' more drugs than a pharmacy
You ain't harmin' me, so pardon me
Pass the safe, before I blaze the place
And here's six shots just in case

Wit the Koreans

Wit land in Korea
Take the leer jet flight
When?
Thursday night
Overseas
Yo, a fuck up is worth they life
Huh, ya'll niggas heard me right
What, for that persian white
I go to church of christ
Search in sight
First to heist a nigga for they merchandise
My niggas brawl for weight
Sprinkle ten grams of coke on their corn flakes
To make 'em frosted flakes
All the jewels on my neck
You'll say the Lord I'm saved
My shit cost some cake
You think you, can afford a date
But yo your men should know
That my crew, we intend to blow
Treat you cats like Martin Lawrence
And motherfuckin end your show
When I say no
What youn understand the N or O
Like that nigga Jigga said
Yo, you either friend or foe
So respect my wish
I'm a perfectionist
And wit the gun
Is the only time a nigga plays catch and kiss
Check the list, how many necks I twist
Who expected this, Exodus
Blow over night, or even sex a bitch
But she catch feelings everytime I hit her off
On my dick so bad I need Cochran to get her off
Ask my nigga Digga
Or my other nigga Mr. Ross
I pray we get across
To make it that youll get a cross
And casket suit, and I ain't wanna holler grave
But you live in the burbs'
Your visits on the holidays

How you feel about me
Yo, I think I'm pretty hot
When I rhyme
Niggas grab they dick and diddy bop
And pull they skully down
And put their ice grill on
Like they don't trust a nigga
And walk around the club
Like they 'bout to crush a nigga
I get a nigga mad enough to where he snuff a nigga
Don't have to toast
Yo you fuck around and bust a nigga
You got to love a nigga
The way I crime what
Out west they fuckin throwin gang signs up
Wildin all night and don't care where they wind up
Next day same ice grill inside a lineup
Ya'll niggas times up
Don't mean to trouble you
I'll snatch your kids quicker than B.C.W
What you mad about? I see a lot of tightened jaws
I got a lot of hoes, but I'm really, really liking yours
Not to nag her, 'bout if I can bag her
It ain't if I can have her, it's how I'm gon' have her
Lay her like a quarterback
On her back
On the mat
Found out that you wanna act
We ran through her
You want her back?
Come on wit that
You kiss a hoe
Yo when the bitch leaves
You fuck around and miss the hoe
Oh, I'm the type to twist the hoe then diss the hoe
Choke and threaten to kill her, like her last name's Carlesimo
Listen yo, trick the hoe and get her dough
That was Pryor like Richard, yo
Cause I done been around the world
See I met Puff and I know Mason
But still the best nation
Nigga is donation
So let me hold somethin
Yo, you can't change my livin'
This robbery's a holiday
Call it Thanksforgivin'
Cause you a turkey
Talkin' bout you sell weight
Nigga you had soul mates, I had cell mates
But now I've been with the same three gunners
For the same three summers
And dice love me
They stay on the same three numbers

You love the way I rep black step the F back
'Fore we out the guns and test chat, respect that
Any girl I met that, hit that, love the way I spit that
I don't Kit Kat, push your wig back, get you shit snatched
Get your ribs cracked, got a frontin’ habit, kick that
Get that, sit back, school shit, skipped that
Learn how to flip packs, for the big stacks
And the big Ac', now I got the big gat
Click, clack, uhh
Since day one been in a ditch
Kin with a snitch
Now I'm in the pen in the mix
Friends sending me flicks
Girls sending me kicks
Been in some shit
Had to tap a chin with a fist
Pulled the banger out and blew 'em
Begin with a stitch
End in a kiss
C.O., so I blend in the mix
Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
8½ on the dope ask Dominican Rich
Winning and rich
Eating on cinnamon grits
Grinning and shit
How a nigga spin in 6
See they all say V12
But you see me in it
TVs in it
BB kitted
Ask who it is
You see me tinted
I did drive-bys
Now I take you on top of a high rise
See if you can skydive
I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
How 'bout the Palladium
Fuck it Yankees Stadium uhh
Play people, jumped up and sprayed people
I got dudes that'll jig you with a AIDS needle
You not a threat
You want it you got it bet
I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet
Nigga when I’m upset
I'll go another route
Kidnap your family make you brother eat your mother out
After I done dug her out
Needles to drug her out
Pillows to smother out
You don't give a fuck about, I'm what a thug about
I'm through with it
Your crew ain't even true with it
I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
I know you pack like that
But Cam why you act like that
Shut up nigga clack clack clack
Pat pat pat
Rat tat tat
Prepare for envy nigga
I'm not in fear of any
I'll leave a nigga black and blue
Like a pair of Penny's
While me and Betha
Throw fiestas
By alma queta
Chicqueta, monero, nieta
Don't ever fuck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the chancletas
Or the black boots, jumpin’ out the Ac' Coupe
Cars never lease 'em
Girls, geese 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants gotta crease 'em
All cards valid
Never hard malice

Been up in your favorite star's stylist

Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
But you should thank Un though
Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door

Aiyyo I'm crook with the cap, cook up the crack
Every time you look up a gat
Got you shook up a tad huh
Look in the back, nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up and chat
On this bookend of rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the fuck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns, you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year bid, life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner, you a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain damp
Light this herb
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know Stealers/Steelers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnappings and hostages
So, y'all better obey

Mess with us no way

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Is he a Blood, is he Crip?
Is he that, is he this?
Did he do it? Y'know, ehh
Look

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
If I shoot you, I'm brainless
Different toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin' this
I'm waitin' on arraignment, my nigga is the plaintiff
Yeah, I know what you thinkin' - fucked up ain't it?
I shoulda known better, and I planned to
But dog they be takin' me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle
I sat back and watched it, put the Gats back in the closet
They tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage
Let niggas take shots at me, no response
I just flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz
You give a nigga a foot, he'll take you one step beyond
He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm
You wanna conversate with the writer of the Qu'ran
Or Old Testament, don't test him then
I know what y'all thinkin' dick, pause
Your future's my past, I've been here before
I know when you're schemin', I feel when you plottin'
I got, mental vision, intuition
I know where you goin' I read your mind's navigational system
Everybody whisperin' - pst pst pst ss perspirin'


[Chorus: Jay-Z]
When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know... geah geah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah...

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin'
And I only use his waist to keep my Glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doing the poppin'
And if you don't know, guess who's doin' the droppin'
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move; that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose
Before you realize that it's probably true?
Whatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do
Shit, I paid my dues, I made the news
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews
And the streets say Jigga can't go back home
You know when I heard that? When I was back home
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome
On any Martin Luther, don't part with your future
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya
The answer is simply too dark for the user
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?
'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone
From what the block has spoken, my God
Everybody stressin', who's his baby's moms?
Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ahh...


[Chorus: Jay-Z]
When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know... chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah
Chicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah
When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know.. gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh
Yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know
I lost my Pops when I was eleven, mmm, twelve years old
He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin' it's toll
But I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad!
I grew up pushin' snowflake to niggas that was pro-base
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game
I seen niggas before me, with a chance to write they own script
Slip up and change the story
I seen young niggas go out in a blaze of glory
Before reachin' puberty, scared a nigga truthfully
I took trips with so much shit in the whip
That if the cops pulled us over the dog a get sick, sniff
Smell me, nigga? The real me, nigga, minus the rumors
Holla if you feel me, nigga


[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]
The streets is not only watchin' but they talkin' now?
Shit, they got me circlin' the block before I'm parkin' now
Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin', I'm just cautious now
Sub, under the parka, extra cartridge now
Hit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense
I get word to the street like Bell Atlantic and Sprint
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in Jumu'ah I know 'stafALLAH
Niggas wanna press me, put my back to the wall
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all
To know me's to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this
Fuck you, I got guns like Neo in Matrix
Cross the Family, think Mac's sweet like Karo
Or soft like Play-Doh, get knocked off like Fredo Corleone
They find you with a hole in your dome
I roll with niggas that'll follow you and go to your home
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense
Catch you while you reachin'
Clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin'
Apply full court pressure
Like .44 Taurus get you out of here, pull pressure
To the trigger, bullets fly in three's
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt, lies and leaves
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave
Look in my eyes, realize it's Beans
Niggas wanna despise the team; 'til I play head coach
And straight up, divide they team
Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things
'Til the bullet.. ah, motherfuckers!! Yeah..",Rockin and Rollin,Cam'ron

Dipset (Hell Rell)

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Yo, yo I speak pain, I spit power, talk courage, breathe flowers
Follow me through the debris of these towers
The rain, the sleet, the street showers
Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour
The soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together
In the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got the fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up, you know
You already know what I'm about homie
I'm young, I'm focused, I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me (woo!)
No, I ain't stopping yet (yeah)
No, my album ain't done, it ain't dropping yet
I'm in the midst of a bidding war
And we need two mil' more just to move in the door, shit


[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
So line 'em up, shoot 'em down

Killa, yo
Your girl told you I'm the man, right? (Right?)
Well listen to lover
When I beef, visions are gutter
Kids clapping, kidnappings, heard her missing a brother
I'm hitting your sister, you kissing your mother
This shit'll disgust ya
Underground with people, lethal
Trapped in the desert, surrounded by Eagles (Dipset, girl)
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest by Mitchell and Ness (jersey)
Got her open, hoping she's not
I'll have her, crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She get cracked up and hit, keep soap in your sock, mami (mami)
My girls lay up in suites
A half a cake a week, and masturbate like Tweet, Killa
I be popping them Uzis, copping them Coogis
Eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is Snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking her rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that'll merk you like Jayson Williams (uh huh)
Don't play with villains, vacate the building
Or the apes'll come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram
I'm still the man, word to Killa Cam (Killa)

Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
So line 'em up, shoot 'em down

Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line 'em up, shoot 'em down

Come holla at us, the boys are back at it

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
To all of my cons and crooks, slash that to of my pawns and rooks
For all the charms they took
To my head of security, British the Titan, clicking the fifth, and gripping it tight, goddamn it
Not to mention my bishop and knights, soliciting bricks of the white
Making crucial trips through the night (highways)
And Prince Juelz, I told you ever since Juelz
If them faggots even flinch Juelz (bluuuuatttt)
My dogs gonna 'em alive
Forty-four's depleting, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa while he's leading the movement
For realer we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in the tombs, just facing my time
Lawyer on side, outside spoiler on ride
System bumping, bumping Oh Boy in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit
He done came got his boy, it's a shame that his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employ
Which is none other
Than Dipset, for y'all dumb motherfuckers (holla)


[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yes, the boys are back at it
Come holla at us, the boys are back at it
So line 'em up, shoot 'em down
Do it now
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line 'em up, shoot 'em down

Wait 'till my face start poppin' on TV
See the ladies give me top for cheapy
All they wanna do is just hop on the wee-wee
My rich chick'll take a helicopter to see me
I pop Dominican and she'll drop me a key free

Even got a lawyer a cop in the DT
See I got money but I ain't spendin' it

'Cuz honey bunch I ain't wit the funny stuff
You ain't gone fuck me to spend my money up

And all he askin' me about is the Freeway tape
I'm like, ""If I ain't right you can say I'm wrong
But Mr. DJ can you play my song?""
Please, play somethin' that's good for the air
Please, play somethin' that the hood wanna hear
So when the radio go to put that trash on
Call 'em up and say, ""Put that Cass on!""
And I ain't pissin' nobody
But if every rapper died I wouldn't be missin' nobody
'Specially if it ain't Styles, 'Kiss or nobody
Busta, Nore, Swizz or nobody
If it ain't Drag, Kim or Fat Joe
I could care less if a cat gotta lay on his back, yo
So, I don't owe y'all niggas
And y'all might be aight but I don't know y'all niggas
I mean, it's a couple other niggas that I've met
With the FS on my chest without press
I got love for Snoop, Puff and Wyclef
And my niggas Esco, so let's go, yo
Get money nigga, fuck the fame

Pour out half of that shit
Pour out half of that shit, 'fore you pass it to me nigga!
Just missin them summer jams
Summer jams at the Apollo, the Greek Fest-es

Thinkin about them good ol days and times
Word up, this is for them, spit that shit

Aiyyo I grew up like the regular thugs, I think I told you that
My only means of gettin money was just sellin crack
Outside a nigga did a bid, nigga all of that
So now I kick back, and get paid for raw rap
My nigga 'Pone ain't home, not yet
Yo it really don't matter just be zoned on the same set
Me and Trag kick it, on the here and there
Don't really hang too tough, but the love is there
My pops died on July 3rd
Ninety-Eight so now a nigga need mad herb
Cause my, pops is here aiyyo he loved his son
Matter of fact my pops was the one to show me a gun
And said, ""Papi, you gotta protect your moms
Even if that means that you gotta strap up arms""
He used to make me hit the punching bag, my dad
He was a boxin God, and he was real he was glad
Yo the boxin the Golden Glove, he just a thug
And I love him yo, so I'mma spread that love

Locked in with me, your legacy lives on with me continuously
Tremendously I blow weed deep in my memory
You still breathe, your face show through your seeds
And who would know one day you'd go so quick, we all felt hopeless
Through blunt smoke my pen spittin and I show this
A sworn oath you would know this, I go the lengths
With my rap strengths, when I think about my past friends
K-Rock and Diesel, Primo from the same block as me
Since we was shorties, they're paintin project glory
I get touched, it all absorb me like a weed head rush
Keepin' it thorough for my past heroes
I must for my people, street and physical, I still see you
Featured in my heart, sometimes it might wrinkle
Much drinkin' when I'm thinkin', it's like I feel a hush
Over the skies touched by dead guys speakin'

Recognize my presence, this rap game specialized with legends
I drop shit niggas try to memorize in seconds
You criticize me, still visualize the lessons
And when I wish to put aside the questions
Before they find out, who's the realest
Who done spoke without one joke about the illest
Shit that ever happened, in this rappin' beyond rappin'
Joe the God it ain't so hard to start clappin'
But I lay low, create flows, for the pesos
Now we got extra hoes, wantin' to chase shows
I take foes, and break em down to minerals
We went from street corner thugs to white collar criminals
Individuals, with no peace on the quest
The iced out, piece on my chest, from the East to the West
Never sleep in a sweat, keep the heat with the vest
Ready for the 'casian blazin' gettin deep with the best
The police wanna test my strategy, got half of the world
Mad at me, but very few challenge me
Perhaps you will be the first to approach this, lyrical dope shit
Cartagena will bring the chrome like explosives

Hit you with the tech and the armor, you see-saw
That's my steez, if I don't kill you I'mma clap you these
Ask your peeps if I ain't have the beast soundin' Japanese
Coughin' blood, that's what you get for talkin' thug
Run up on your preacher with the sweeper feature coughin' slugs
Once a thug always a thug, hallways and drug dealers
Fillers, killers, they wanna chill all day with us
They love the Don, these words are more than just another song
If I said I slit your neck, your jugular's gone
Ain't nothin' artificial, Joe the God, the Terror Squad official
Got a lot of pistols with missiles, Pray Allah is with you
The shit you say'll get you sprayed with the clapper

Leave the 'hood, I would but it got Cam twisted (twisted)
When Mikey gon' get that butter or them damn biscuits?!
Mother still getting high, she so damn gifted
Like she got no legs though...she can't kick it (nope)
We can't kick it, my man dig it, I Van Wyck it
Wicked wiggle, the man wicked, rap was Cam's ticket (that's what I thought)
But it backfired, air in the back tires
Get ready for crack buyers, rap liars and trap wires
Thinking I'm awry, we thinking I'm raunchy
Watch ""Menace II Society""...think about Chauncey (shhh, think about that)
The snitch factor, now it's a big factor
Shit, life's a bitch watch ya shit for you pitch after
Get dadda, Michelle home from school, her man Rich slapped her
Kitch scratched her, shot in the air...yeah kids scattered
Cause she joined a fraternity...the bitch ""Kappa""
He ain't like it, kidnapped her
In the hood, bitch cracker
Now Rich not....she could of met a rich cracker
She get high, worked at Mickey Dees, they Big Mac'ed her
They'll train the fighters, Titus gained Arthritis
Cops they train the buyers, with Kelina can't indict us (nope)
He beat them cases up like Mike Tyson '86
That's why it's like I got a license for these 80 bricks
Crib, tried to raid the shit
Agents on some hater shit
$60k to rob the kid, them cases never made 'em stick


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can promise this, you dealing with a Communist
That'll pull the trigger on any nigga and bomb a bitch
My accomplices...they remain annonymous
And they gon stay there, I swear....I'm what honest is
Honestly you thought I quit like Tomjanavich
Conglomerate, treat you like Ramadan...honor it (y'all won't eat!)
Y'all won't eat, I'm unloading a lobster & pasta
Y'all imposters, imposing my posture....I gotcha
Mobsters with choppers, enough ""dado"" (that's chips)
Chicks...duct tape em, turn 'em over....butt rape 'em
Grams...cut, shave 'em, damn hair cut shavin'
But bust on her hussers like a lust....Wes Craven
That's the hustle...I'm old school, you must page him
Whatever love hate em, won't do...touch, play em...
Degrade em? talk slick...fuck it your all sick
Lay you in dog shit, look over you...hork spit
Beef on Bobby block, right where his homeys walk
Homey we make bodies drop..then skate like Tony Hawk
Over short paper, play a O for very long
Fourth of July: M80's, cherry bombs (what's that?)
They'll disguise the slugs
Sent his friends for them ends
They had 'em like the Benz:
His eyes was bugged
Watch the don poke you
But for $4500 I will John Doe you
Your moms won't know you (KILLA!)",Lord You Know,Cam'ron
Something New,Cam'ron,"9 ContributorsSomething New Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron]
Look ma
I don't care who you with, I ain't here to shoot the shit
You see me, you gon' see an exclusive whip
A coupe de six, that's neither here nor there
But we can be here or there, you feel me?
I'm Killa, so that means you're dealing with scrilla
You ever felt Chinchilla, huh?

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Killa!
Ayo she even on the internet (computer), or watching lifetime (TV)
But she never met me in her lifetime (never)
Wore a size five (five), roll with five-nine (nine)
I keep nine nines, nine for the pipeline

[Verse 2: Hell Rell]
And they call me Ruger Rell, how you doing baby? (what's good?)
I'm like U-Haul with the bricks, I can move 'em baby
Yeah Mr Campbell, I'm kind of suped ma
But I ain't into talking unless you getting in the coupe mama

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Yeah, plus her eyes hot (hot), get in my drop (drop)
She said why, shit I'm like why not? (C'mon)
Where you wanna go, the waffle house IHOP?
Now sit ya head in my lap, meet cyclops


[Verse 4: Hell Rell]
Or we can do Mr. K's on the weekdays
Steakhouse weekends, feeling using sheepskins (word)
Now I'm all grown up with a peach Benz (that's right)
I'm tryna fuck, I ain't really wanna be friends

[Chorus: Cam'ron]
She fly (she fly), she cute (she cute)
She ride (in what?), in coupes (oh)
She shrewd, she nice, she rude (Killa!)
But she still want something new

[Verse 5: Cam'ron]
Dipset, remember some are crazy (loco)
But you been mad since Brenda had a baby ('91)
I'm just a offspring, members of the '80s
Give surrender to his lady, get offended if they play me (whoa!)
I know, a lot of men are phony
You just looking for that homey that can be your tenderoni (tenderoni)
The one and only, that stop from being lonely
The Chachi to your Joanie, to rock ya little pony

[Verse 6: Hell Rell]
Hell Rell and a model sitting in a GT
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First come love, nah it ain't love
I'm a gangsta, make her hold my guns and my drugs
Yeah I know she feeling a gangsta
But it's hard for her to deal with a gangsta
'Cause there's certain things she gotta do to keep me happy
Fry some good chicken, when I hit it call me daddy
I'm from Weeks Ave mama, I get cash mama
Those some sexy thighs, I like that ass mama
I'm something like a G cause I bust my mag
Mama you don't love me, you just love my swag


[Chorus: Cam'ron]
She fly (she fly), she cute (she cute)
She ride (in what?), in coupes (oh)
She shrewd, she nice, she rude (Killa!)
But she still want something new

[Verse 7: Cam'ron]
And I'm lactose intolerant
Pack toast, no tolerance
Black MAC in backpack, Blackjack and holla since
Any turbulence (turbulence), we'll go to Providence
I keep the murder tints, on the Impala mint
Any murder prints? (shh), no acknowledgement
I go to work sir (sir), she in college miss
If I like her I'm cuffing her
The wife of a hustler, be nice to ya customers (customers)
When she bite it I muzzle her
Tight when I cuddle her, that's right when I puzzle her (puzzle her)
Yeah I'm right for the jugular
I ain't tryna juggle ya, diamonds when I smother her, Killa!

[Verse 8: Hell Rell]
And you know all my guns got a muffler
Just wanna see the slut in her, I don't want a hug from her (nope)
This the life and I'm living it up
If you wanna be with a G, then get in my truck (get in), yeah


[Chorus: Cam'ron]
She fly (she fly), she cute (she cute)
She ride (in what?), in coupes (oh)
She shrewd, she nice, she rude
But she still want something new",Lord You Know,Cam'ron

One false move and your body ripped, niggas lay in they lobbies hit
Kickback of my gun is like a karate flick, Gotti shit
Mothers and hotties hit, we stash cash sellin dope'n
Cops on the rooftop be telescopin, be tryin to bust your melon open
Gates of heaven is closed, hell is open, shells are smokin
Road blocks, yellow tape from four shots
Murder plot door knocks, heads drop inside of co-ops
Get buried in corn crops, with tall tops
Hammers drop, magnums pop, you get spotted
On some six o'clock shit on your Magnavox
Taggin your knot, stab a lot, with ice pick shit, Obituary RIP shit
Iller than Pillsbury with the biscuits

Yea, im gettin mine on the back end

Break a few of em down but im lettin the rest fly
Goin thru changes, but they are not dangerous
Get dope money but speakin cocaine game language

The murder rate got the hate on subliminal
Always raspy till the day they blast me

Put a nigga in the casket off cast be

Two Pits off the leash Quadna then Benita
And you keep lyin thats why its hard to believe ya
Gon need a free safety to guard the reciever

Only pay your respect before they put him in the ground
When the birds land nigga guess who put em in the town
So the pitchers is out, guess who put em on the mound

Alter a nigga, nina talk to a nigga (Yeah)
Take a chunk out your body like a shark bit a nigga (Damn)
I'm awkward like Cartwright, fuck with a nigga
Shot ugly, but my arch right, come on, dawg, bark, bite (Nothin')
Fork in the road, I'm always going right
Nowadays, knowing life, ain't no more road lights (Woah)
We can't see, but we gon' make it to the finish line
It's right there, the goal line right behind the scrimmage line (Hut)
Touchdown, check the scoreboard, give me mines (Yeah)
Semi nine fit me fine, hit a nigga twenty times (Bah-bah-bah-bah, bah)
Damn, then one more to the face (Bah)
Just so they close the casket like I pay to close the case (Yeah)
I'm made, straight mafia shit
Front line, top rank, ready to die for my shit (Yeah)
And the obvious shit?
If I talk about my rivalry, they probably get rich
So fuck 'em, I'ma let 'em sit (Yeah)
And I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here (Right here), I'm chestin' up
I don't care who at the top of the stairs, I'm steppin' up (Woah)
See, you fucking up the money, baby
And that ain't good business
You starting to look like a witness (Fuck 'em)
And this is for the gangsters and the bitches (Yeah)
The hustlers and the hoes (Yeah)
Crossover? Whatever, mainstream? No
'Cause Wayne thinks silent (Ah), Wayne'll never fold (Uh-uh)
You heard it right here if the game was ever told (Nigga)
Lift up your toes and look under a rug
Trust me, that's history under all that dust
So deep down in the dirty, there lies us (Who?)
Yeah, Cash Money Records, and I'm still upfront (Yeah)
Stunna, pop a bottle, baby, peel us a blunt
Let's eat and talk about all of the niggas we cut
But, you know what? Let's not fuck up our lunch
That's real shit if you ever seen such, church

This is the archetypal rock sound
Ok this really ain't no rock shit
But um, leggo!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove monster, New Orleans maniac
Shoot a nigga up until his whole body ain't attached
Hi, my name is best rapper alive
And your mouth is the best crapper alive
'Cause you talk shit, I get hit and walk it off
Like fuck that, then I just spit like barking dogs
Call it ""bust-back,"" attitude like ""fuck em all""
And I'm greasy, and your boyfriend is a butterball
What's geezy? I mean what's good? Bitch, is you blind?
Check my watch, bet it be money all the time
Sunny on the side where I stay at
Where M.I.A. at? I get pussy every time I say that
Haha! In the game room, I don't play that
Bitch nigga get laid down where he lay at
AK at your front door, Young Zoe
You can ask Brisco, shoot 'til my wrist sore
Coupe with a bitch low, who with the sick pour
I'm tired of the south, so in your mouth is where the dick go
Yeahhh! They like it when I say yeah, huh?
And your boyfriend's a tampon
And I don't own land, baby, I own a landmine
So step on my land and catch a bomb like Anquan
Weezy F and the 'F' is for franchise
You looking at me is like you're looking through ant eyes
Hahaha! Young Money can't die
Bitch, we like Hancock
Yeah, I'm a Martian; what you saying, Spock?
I turn your beef into a hamhock
Then I put it in a pan pot, shoot 'til my hand hot
I can't hear you saying stop, I hear nina saying ""pop""
I hear choppers saying ""chop""
I hear niggas screaming and shit, like I say ""holla at ya boy, bitch""
But holla at ya boy bitch
I'm the boy bitch, not ya boy bitch, 'cause ya boy a bitch
Hahahaha! Young Moola Crazy!

Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel (Ah)
Tell me that I, I was wrong (Yeah)
I was born to let you go (I was Wrong)

[Verse 1]
Ah this shit ain't been the same since
I let you go and then since yall became tense
We had a burn that could spark any flame
Now I'm like Oran jones walking in the rain
We was too peas in a pod but not the same
You was feeling a thug and despised all lames
You was more for the love and despised all games
And I was more bout the bitches and piling them in the range
(Every Sound) that I hear is telling me I'm wrong
I couldn't say it in your face I'll say it in this song
I could say it million times that I played it wrong
Now I gotta spend my days alone, and um....

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Yeah let it burn let it burn-0, love can be hell in the heart of the Inferno
Teaching me a lesson but I still never learn
So I keep back tracking, move around in a circle
Now I'm hanging out in the club with no purpose
Wall in between us and i can't scratch the surface
I'm starting to feel worthless like was it really worth it
Fucked up so bad I wonder will we ever work it out
But it seems like a long shot my head hurtin' shit, you killin' me
Dome shots, thought that I was scheming but I stumbled on the wrong plot
I admit I did you wrong, ma and on


[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Ah I live in dark days and bright nights
I know I've fallen, I'm tryin to turn my wrongs into rights
Ah but this shit gettin critical, it's crazy
Cause I know that I'm the reason why your miserable
I'm just a man baby doin' what a man does
No question I know your searching for the answers
Aahhah life is so unpredictable I never would of
Predicted I would of got rid of you ah
And I question that a reason
But shit don't just happen, shit happen for a reason
I shoulda kept it loyal it was more like a treason
I shoulda called you back wen you was leaving

Ah man man
Ah man
Niggas don't wanna see me like this man
Hell no man
I'm in the penthouse suite
You know like like
40 floors from seamint
You know what I'm mean?
Lookin down on these niggas like..
Hey I'm just gonna lay back and ride on this one
And they bitch on the way up
What up fool?
Ride with me
Hey Cartoon man
I like that '64 you got me ridin' in nigga
Coast to coast G on the checkin'

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo I kick back and snap at 'em
Sometimes throw thick stacks of trap at 'em
Strut through like a slick mack and rap at 'em
When they act a fool I chick smack and jap at 'em (go and get ya man)
I click clack and clap at 'em
This Tray Pound throw 6 packs of caps at 'em (yeah thats right)
I'm bouncin' on them White Walls again
And the chevy paint is the same shade as Night Crawler's skin
Now throw it up (throw it up)
Let it drop down and pop up
Slow it up
Cause the cops bound to pop up
But I don't give a motherfuck I'm mashin' on the gas
Like I don't see them sirens flashin' on my ass
I'm stashin' on the grass
The choppers in the rear
To catch me they better put them choppers in the air
So when you see me comin' get out my way
Without delay
I'm finnin' to get out the Kay
And let it rip


[Fabolous:]
Hey man this shit is just fun for me man
I'm doin' this shit for a hobby now man
This is what I does man
They just happen to give me a check for it
Oh yeah I get paid too
I don't know
Look like it right?
You might see me in one of them things
That look like a space ship comin' through ya motherfuckin' hood man
If you lucky though I might throw the deuce at you
Only if your lucky

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I'm back in New York like Marbury in the trade
With more jewelry and some shades
But its ordinary when you're paid
The pink and yellow rocks is lookin something like Strawberry Lemonade
They never seen the spokes spin in Brooklyn
When I peel the top back the folks grinnin' lookin'
I'm a hustler
My body scents like Coke when its cookin'
I sweat Heron (Heroin)
Thats why these bitches fiend to get near John
I'm here with a golf stream the jet peel on
Half a mil in bling and sweat there on
Like whats hood?
Can't blame her for lovin' the kid she likes whats good
This is takin' it back to Crenshaw Sunday
If you trip on my set you in for some gun play
In more than one way
I'm a mash on 'em
Like clinger and radar
With the swing of the AR
Motherfucker


[Fabolous:]
I mean I think most of the hoes know me
This shit ain't hard to tell
For the girls that don't
They call me ""Bitch Hop In""
Thats my nickname
(Why they call you that though man?)
So when I land bitch you hop in
(Oh OK)
When I pull up bitch you hop in
(Oh all right)
Simple
(I got it I got it)

Get some smoke that you take a few totes to put it out
Take ya time with it

Now I look back and make a rhyme with it

Laughin' at phoney bitches just deciding to wave
For niggas who all of a sudden decide to be brave
I'm a help you get inside of your grave
Take that with ya

If we can't eat together, then you ain't my man
So when you see me in thе streets, don't shake my hand, if
You got guns and I got guns, let's put our
Guns togethеr and lock this, son
You don't want to roll with me I'mma pop you, son
If you ain't with me, you against me, I don't bite my tongue
I get it gully, bet you like that, huh
Where the weed, nigga light that up
Ayo, I fight the night shifts 'till I knock out mornings
Used to jump crackheads when the block got boring
Come to your hood and make it hot, 'cause I got mine scorching
I walk around with no ID, I got warrants
The cab driver dropped me off, with my mouth yawnin'
He said the cab was seven dollars, but I hopped out on him
Tried to ask me for his bread, so I wild' out on him
'Caught him with a two-piece, left him knocked out snorin'
Niggas takin' this for granted, we want in
He don't want to make enemies, he want friends
Put the gun in his mouth, yeah it's me again
Leave your tongue hangin' out like beat up Timbs
What type of situation did you leave us in?
If you can't write fire, give me your pen
You come from a hood, that we re-up in
BK, that's the borough niggas G'd up in
You better watch, how you pull your V up, slim
Keep the window low enough, so I can see your chin
Who the fuck hood you think your tryin' to creep up in?
If the glass low enough to stick the Nina in
I'mma throw the drop on you and your three-butt-mens
If you ain't creepin' on me, keep your seat up then
Why you keep actin' like you got the brains of prophet?
Pluck y'all niggas and rip you lames out the socket
Lil nigga, you a faggot who came out the closet
Hold you by your ankles and shake your change out your pockets
Got the Heckler & Koch, I ain't even got to cock it, it's double action
Pop you, I pull it out and then lock it
The streets is mine, the bars is mine, give it back
Papoose, I'm the new era like a fitted cap
Rappers ain't the same when you see 'em in person
Some of them act tough 'till you murk 'em
Son know he can't come in my hood, 'cause I'mma hurt him
I stop son from comin' in like curtains
I mastered this, so I spit at you wisely
I'm your master, like your original copy
If I die tryin', I'mma be rich in the afterlife then
At the crossroads to the riches with lavish items
A lot of rappers sellin' their souls, I'd rather price 'em
So pass the scalpel, his Adam's apple, I'll have to slice 'em
You savage triflin' and backwards bitin', dumb acting spiting
My raps enticing, so for my borough I sacrifice 'em
I stab 'em twice and my dagger dice 'em, now that's excitement
They flashin' sirens, they passin' indictments as fast as lightning
Beat you up with my bare hands, you faggots frightened
What did he use to put the beats on 'em? Is that a trident?

Hey Mayor
Ayo Jamz, I see you behind the boards, boy
This sounding real musical, real beautiful, huh
Sorta like the modern day Mozart or some shit, ha
Of course I'm like the modern day Michelangelo
The way I paint these pictures
They ain't gon' quite understand it yet
Let me paint though

[Verse]
The voice of the people that many tried to silence, besides the violence
They're truly fearful of my dеfiance
Their first reaction whеn they was thinking that I'm compliant
You should try the science, politicking with some giants
And try to make an alliance
They underestimated the fearless heart of a lion
That's here to sharpen the iron
The clearest stars in Orion, that wears the scars of a Mayan
There's pain in them clear visions
Doubted every step in this journey but still appear driven
Telling me to take care, but never was no cares given
Crying on them prison tears, tattered up the tears dripping
Dirty ass apartments starving
Empty the frigidaire like ""Mama, why we living here?""
""Baby, at least we here living""
I'm everything that my peers isn't (Peers isn't)
The realest thing that you hear spitting (Hear spitting)
So never could I pretend hater
Was just selling yay and had fiends lighting up stems, player
Born was a terror, was robbing all of my friends' neighbors
Put locks on the jewels, but thanks for giving us gems, Jada
My first rap check, like ""Mama, look what my pen made us""
Me and my brother locked up now, look what the pen made us, huh
Damn, look at what all these men gave up
Stare 'em in they eyes, I feel all the time that they spent caged up
You owe dog, you get Larenz taped up
You so soft, you low carb niggas'll never cake up
We predators that take pride hunting, all of us despise fronting
Look 'em in they eyes, full of vibe
That's when them lies coming
If you got something to hide, that's when you hide something
But when you ain't got nothing to hide, that's when you hide nothing

Take a Good Look,Lloyd Banks,"13 ContributorsTake A Good Look Lyrics[Hook]
Nigga take a good look at this
Princess cuts on my neck and my wrist
Them other niggas can't do it like this
I love my niggas I don't love no bitch
I get the pussy everywhere I go
And every nigga around me got dough
Give me a box of cigars and hydro
G-UNIT-CLICK-YOU-KNOW!!

[Verse 1]
I'm a show you niggas how to leave an impression my flow is amazin'
Male chauvinist, I belong with the cavemen
See most niggas round' here go in the pavement
That's why I smoke so much I don't know where today went
They fascinated by the way my show on the stage went
Bitch I'm a perfect way to blow an engagement
To stop me you gotta put teams and bounties on me
My money long, I need machines to count it for me
I'm glad, they want us dead
But keep runnin' ya mouth and go home with more slices than a bag a' Wonderbread
I'm America's nightmare: Young, black, and chipped up
Plannin' to put more than one plat-num hit up
Standin around where the bums at and gripped up
Layin in the town where they pump crack and cripped up
See everybody knows you stole that tone
Sold a bunch a' records now you scared to go back home (OOHH!!)


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know the kid stay with his Nike's new, the throwback is light blue
Came out around the time, my grandmother graduated high school
Most these rap niggas softer than Ja Rule
And they've been in and out as many walkmans as I do
Take time, to figure out who's walkin' beside you
Cause this sonic can feel like a fork when inside you
You mad, cause ya bitch like us
And all of my records get thumbs up, like I'm ridin' by hitchikers
Stumblin' out the G4, cause that's how tha stars land
Shit I prolly been through more trees than Tarzan
On tha road, tha hoes take a look at tha cars and
It's back tha hotel: titties and bras man
Tha new ""STRAP DON""
You might call me ignorant, but if you cow you belong in tha Phat Farm
When tha lights get bigger I act calm
Prolly cause Im a light skinned nigga with black arms (FUCKA!!)

Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""boom-boom"" and your guns go ""pow-pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques, I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is born, I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it on, and on, and on!
Come on, put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it on, represent, put it on, come on!


[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti (You don't know?), you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed, to tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, big fella, put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, represent!
Put it on, c'mon, put it on!

[Bridge: Major Chubby]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke


[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moët, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I'll see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair, Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L, you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My raps is steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, big fella, put it on and on!
Big L, you gotta put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L, put it on and on!

My man Big L, runnin' things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?

A come on...
Yeah, it's the Big L
Coming at you once again in '95
And I dedicate this one to all my peoples from Uptown and everywhere
Check it

[Verse 1]
Yo, where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a TEC just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
Their life is twisted and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks and bust gats and run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?) 'cause they're street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time


[Verse 2]
Before the rap contract, I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
Ayo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up, 'cause they're street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time


[Verse 3]
I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time I'm in the crib writin' rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin' up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

Word up
Ayo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stay off them corners, and stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the casualties of the streets

Like a fresh TEC out of the box, yo, niggas, I'm testin'
That's no question, bitch-ass, have you confessin'
Like a DT, left in state of depression
You under pressure, in tag, no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher, shooken with asthma, you Casper
You yell my name, that's only givin' me props
Plus the fans that you got wonderin' what's got you hot
It's Tu-Not, knocked out the box and got rocked

Get claptized and set straight, put on your head straight
Watch out for these upstate cats
Be leery of New Yiddy niggas with gats with the wall on they back

You would think that gettin' your head shot's enough, but then
Now you wanna go at my team
Must have been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self

I had the whole New York state
Aimin' at your face at the gate
Bottom line off top soon as you came through
Shots flew, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong-arm niggas ready to rock your shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chopped up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, two G's worth of stitches
To reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My mob's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
With bangers the size of African spears, it's warfare
In the arena, we turn arenas into house of horrors
It's Terrordome, when you see my clique, you need to run behind shit
You got a gat, you better find it
And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'
Who shot ya?
You probably screamed louder than an opera
New York got ya
Now you wanna use my Mobb as a crutch
What you think, you can't get bucked again?
Once again

Back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems

I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas too real, Nas, true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record, I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Gotta keep your eyes open wide and hide your face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from a law man
Gave you fair warnin', now you on the stairs fallin'
I'm callin' out any rapper that I doubt, smack him in the mouth
Throw him in the yoke, boom, then I knock him out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files
Twenty-shot auto Glock, ""blaow!"", Benny Blanc' Puerto Rock style
With a twist of black and I'm proud, twist your cap and I'm out
Sleep with the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
What's happenin' now? Niggas is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down, the hardest regardless
We're size of the largest
We polish the floor with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory, ya niggas can't do shit to me
Physically, lyrically, hypothetically, realistically
I'm the epitome of catchin' wreck
Catch you when you cash your check
Smash you when you pass, then jack you for your fuckin' 'Lex

I'm born to kill and still thrilled to put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse only results in loneliness
Only the strong survive and strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us killed, even massacred
Who wanna try? Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and Hell's your next stop
For real, my shit's cocked, your world has just stopped
I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate and I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe
You never know; however, though, I still hold the title
And owe my rivals a chance to dance with Mr. Homicidal
Hand on the Bible, I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we?
The foundation, you're facin' a whole army

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines, so
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun

And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

[Verse 1: Nas]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody


[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun, yo

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a
Barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's
Return of the golden child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo


[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)


[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

[Outro: Nas & Alabama 3]
Got yourself a gun (Uh)
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun",98 Freestyle,Big L
IZZO (H.O.V.A.),Jay-Z,"151 ContributorsIzzo (H.O.V.A.) Lyrics[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch


[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up


[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up


[Outro]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Up in Whitney, got the MAC with me
Hid behind the Warhol, dip to Bergdorf, shot up the whole store (Brr)
Cherry fifty-seven, in the 'Bach learnin' lessons (Skrrt)
Crack ain't dry yet, it be ready in a second (Ah)
Forty chains on, halo, I'm a god, nigga
Fear of God jogger rockin', nigga, I don't even jog
Hangin' out the Wagen sunroof, pick a nigga off (Brr)
The Mille with the chill bezel (Ah)
All my foreigns red, it make me feel special
Banana peel AK, I'm lookin' real extra (Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot)
With the top keys, the money green Teslas (Skrrt)
Told Virgil write ""Brick"" on my brick (Write ""Brick"" on my brick)
Write ""Brick"" on my brick
Told Virgil write ""Brick"" on my brick
Ayo, Amiris filled with cash, I'm in the fashion district (Ah)
Shoot your momma house just for a half a bicken (Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot)
All my niggas dealin', all my niggas killin' (Brr)

Water whip coke, I still Voss it, rosé out the faucet
Ah, tell Virgil write ""Brick"" on my brick


[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
Look, lil' brodie let off his thirty, he ain't even flinch (Yeah)
Caught the body, dipped to the A, nobody seen him since (He got lost)
Five-sixty Benz and I ain't need the tints (Vroom)
My weakest scent cost more than your mama need for rent (Hahaha)
That just for one zip, the drum rip, leave you rinsed (Rrah)
Hide the body for a week and it's gon' leave a stench (You smell that?)
Rappers come to my city, they gon' need consent (You need a pass, nigga)
'Cause we already know you pussy, nigga, we convinced (Hah)
I told Virgil write ""Brick"" on my brick (Hah)
The nicest with this shit, ain't write this, I just spit (Woo)
White bitch on my dick, this ice drip on my fist
No shoe deal, but look at all this Nike shit that I get (Hahaha, yeah)
On Doat Street, it's white shit that I pitch
Two in the morning, on the corner, night shift with my blick (I got it all)
No soda in this off-white shit that I whip (Hah)
I'm rich, put all this Off-White shit on my bitch (Yeah, haha)
So if it's smoke, we ain't even askin' (Uh-huh)
We just pullin' up and somebody gon' see a casket (Boom boom boom)

Every time Griselda drop, this shit gon' be a classic (You know what's up)

Yo, I gave cocaine to users, and okays to shooters (I did)
I'm cocky, vintage Versace with the stone face Medusas
Sopranos at Maggiano's, we got gold-plated Rugers
This pistol'll backflip you and blow your whole frame to Pluto (Brr)
Got all eyes on us, can we chill? Eatin' with snakes'll probably get him killed
'Cause trust me, every family had a Henry Hill (What else?)
And every man don't got a Benny skill (Nah)
When you this dope, it take least 50 mil' just to sit me still (Ah)
Light ten on my whip, white bitch on my dick
Right wrist when I whip, that white brick on my brick
Runway Margiela, that type shit on my bitch
Butterflies and spikes, that type shit on my kicks
These rappers wanna be trendy (Nah), they hoes wanna be friendly
But never, she wear Forever 21 like it's Fendi (Punk bitch)
I told that bitch it's Givenchy, she pronounce it ""Givinchy""
She wanna fuck me and run through all my accounts 'til they empty
What would ChineGun do? I'm still thinkin' militant
Old paraphernalia layin' around, I got rid of it (That's out of here)
Then settled all my differences (I did)

And, um, to my niggas too (Who?)

(What up? What up?)

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got my clique ready, ready for hand-to-hand combo
Palms break him down, Rapper Noyd cut his throat
Don scoop him up, ah, Gotti stomp him out
Each twin grab an arm, pick this nigga up
Nitty turn his face to me and let me wake him up
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big
It almost took his whole face off
We got the team positioned, ready for faceoff
We blitz like Dallas in the Super Bowl faceoff
We form like niggas in the yard up north
With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost
To take your life lost, never found again, boss
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths
Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit (Light it up, son)
Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah, you a sick
Lunatic, nigga jump up, but got hit
With MACs and TECs and silencers spit
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
That's the sound of a nigga almost felt it
Got you runnin', dodgin', coverin', shelterin'
Bullets rippin' through the fabric of your shirt, it's meltin' in
You bleed again, you just another nigga dealt with
Intruder alert, our house is nothin' like the Covenant
We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven


[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yo, if it ain't drama, money or bum, broke bitches
Simple-minded niggas out for Havoc position
That's opposition, wettin' me calm edition
Suddenly and outta the blue and now I see
Find myself by myself and rollin' mad trees
Paranoid on point and now I see who's who
Distinguish fake ones outta the immediate crew
Life, I take one if you jeopardize mine, duke
You're small, minute, got a deck to deal with aces up
You overbidded and in the Bridge, you got stuck
This ain't a card game, but in perspective, it's the same
Put two and two together, Mobb Deep with one name
Contain drama like Outbreak
You order drama, we outtake, then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you up from the waist up
That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
But our beats bangin', got your whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin', four pound left ya ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete
Niggas is trash rhymin', totally offbeat
And outta sync with they life, E&J been tight
Nigga, slow your roll
You're speedin', now you bleedin' tonight for no reason
Wanna be macks and thugs, get smacked, show no love
Crush your team like a bear hug
The Infamous'll do dirt that'll smear like mud
New York, New Yitty, Queens, I feel no pity, no remorse
Takin' it to the source of course
Where that ass, thug real, kid, it's only your mask
That you wear, take off, cop out, feel the blast
Who on top of boom, gat-for-gat
And all the wolves got the drop on you
And let the nickel-nine pop on you


[Verse 3: Prodigy & Havoc]
Yo, my crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats blowing outta your back
What the deal with them tough looks and eye contact?
Starin' all up in your cornea, your cornea lack
The look of a true-to-life, crime niggas attack
Go at the first nigga that front and overreact
You get dealt with, dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
You get dealt with, dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
Dealt with quick

Oh! You can search in the gutter down low
You can even wait 'til the mountain comes down
And if you wanna wait 'til the river runs dry
But you'll never find another one
You can search around the whole damn globe
Search from in the North, to the East, Westside
I bet your bottom dime
No matter what you do, you'll never find another one

[Verse 1]
Hey yo this chronic got me to', I try to shake it and break it
Thinkin it won't go, I went to see the doctor
X-rays it won't show, I even wrapped myself up in blankets
Just like a cold cause I'm so sick-wid-it
It just happened on a song, I feel it in my eyes
My urrs and in my nose, my fingers and my toes
Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a facelift
I'm just so hungry I can taste it
Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter
Pushin buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Chk-chicka, here you go, please come another day
I waited a lot of winter days and summer nights to rock the mic
City locked down, right before me and the other 'Tics went down
You fuckin right it went down
Fuckin right I drink Crown, fuckin right we move crowds
It's a Derty E-N-T thang, want ya pretty sweet thang

You just remember why you do that right thurr, uh
I made it tight to be country, they thought country was bummy
Until country start makin money, now they all in Kentucky
Oklahomas and Nashvilles, they givin out record deals
(They eventually had their shot) man they been had skills
But leave it up to Moses, cause he gon' lead us out
I made the world accept on how we speak and how we shout
I started that whassup dirty, that dirty how ya doin'
I let the dirty go up and now niggas runnin' through it
Huh, that's why I did it - mayne, just don't forget it - mayne
The whole world know I killed it but I still get acquited - mayne
I'm a thoroughbred, with some thorough bread
I got a thorough chick waitin' with some thorough head
I'mma pro model, I'm fitted for the new era ranks
I should move to Bel-Air the way I fill up banks

I take a pair of black nines and I'm - the man
I said a pair of black nines make 'em - jump man
I push your wig from the back to the - front man
Just cause I'm peaceful don't mistake me for no - punk man
Shit I'mma come clean, I should sleep on the triple beam
I'm too damn dope nigga to hang around fiends
Plus a team, playa, I never play the team
Cause even if I win, we all gettin' rings

Matter of fact, I should hit a note now just for the hell of it

All these rappers wanna talk about how much money they got, how much work they done flipped
I don't see none a' you niggas out here, nigga I'm out here for real
A nigga tell you my life is real nigga what?

Since everybody rich now
Fuck it I'm broke
All these rappers talking bricks now

I got murder on my mind
And niggas tryna murda me
Bright like a bounty hunter blood in all burgundy
Gangsta like a crip hollerin cuz you done heard a' me
Standin over this stove won't these niggas worry me
Can't no rapper bury me
I be trappin thoroughly
Freeway Ricky Ross be home in the March
I got it all together
Ain't nothin fell apart
Be lyin if I sit here and act like this shit ain't hard
They tellin me ""celebrity""
""Buck you a celebrity""
But if I don't eat, that put my kids life in jeopardy
All this fuckin jealousy
I'm buyin all this weaponry
And I'm listenin to ever word that T.I. tellin me
And I'm flippin every last bird Jeezy sellin me

Crazy bout the money
All these traps made a nigga relapse
They see me and they wonder damn does he still rap?
He out here with the goons so ya gotta feel that
What happened to the morals
When niggas had rules
You had to put in work and pay ya dues Or Ya lose
Now niggas is confused
Cuz now they gettin four and a half
Lease a car and make it look like you got more than ya have
And these rappers ain't no better they just sayin whatever
Will me and 50 work this shit out?
Naaw I ain't sayin never
But I will say now I'm on a whole 'nother level
From the music to the business to the ghetto

Come OUt To Play,Anybody Killa,"4 ContributorsCome Out to Play Lyrics[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
Where you at motherfucker heard you been talking shit (What?)
But every time, I come around it's like you seem to forget
Shut your mouth you little ho before I scalp your lip
In other words you'll be a dead little punk ass bitch
I won't forget you every time I'm pissing over your grave
Or when I'm slanging peyote in hoods that you once claimed
Learn about the tribe you're dissing 'cause we all ain't the same
Tomahawk steady swinging as I'm dancing for rain
So come and play with me, at least until the sky turns grey
Shooting off my arrows like AK's
Amazing situations, four colors of man, represent the wicked nation (Nation)
Underground street level, running this course
Keeping you shady bitches scared to come up off your porch
So come and hang with me, unless you blaming me
Because the native hydro keeps changin' me

[Hook: Violent J & Anybody Killa]
Come and play with me, come play with me
(Even if it means your death)
Though you hated me, come play with me
(My tomahawk swings right to left)
You bet just wait and see, come play with me
(I'll be a juggalo till my very last breath)
Then you hate to see, come play with me
(These hatchet men up on our chest)


[Verse 2: Anybody Killa & Shaggy 2 Dope]
Warriors, come out and play
Roaches I spray, I'm ABK
I'd rather be dead than fade away
All my life I been a scrub, I wouldn't change a day (Yup!)
What I'm saying quit playin', I'm a tell you how it's slaying
See me in the streets psychopathic chain just swayin' (Who?)
Anybody Killa so it ain't no delayin'
Dead body six feet in the ground decayin'
When I come I'll rub the serial numbers from my gun out
The tribal war paint on my face will make you run out (Whoo!)
Bust shots in the sky and shoot the sun out
An keep us in the clip until every last run out (Bah!)
Erasing all the drama that this world brings
Moon light shine bright on shattered dreams

Throwing east in the air when we walk past, think fast
You can be a hater with a lot to say
But you're talkin' from the door, so come out and play

Now You Know,Anybody Killa,"2 ContributorsNow You Know Lyrics[Intro: Anybody Killa]
If you don't know now you know
If you don't know now you know

[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
First off, let me speak
There's some crazy motherfuckers I've been dying to teach
About the ways of the underground
How it spins round and round by adding those terrifying sounds
Make your way from the East to the West
And the North and the South Juggalos hear me out
You wanna know about me well it's time for me to tell ya (What?)
But it's nothing familiar
Known on the streets as ABK
Busting caps at the strays with a rusty ass throw away
If you scared, turn the lights on
I can see your heart steady pounding, so I bet it won't last long
Pack the weed in the bong, take a hit
And reminisce about some bullshit
That's how it is when you're out of control
A little something that I thought you should know (Thought you should know!)

[Chorus: Anybody Killa]
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (What?!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Come on!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Yeah!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Why you wanna know about us?)


[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
Did you learn a little bit from the rhymes that I spit?
If not well it goes like this (Like this!)
I'm crazy, fucked in the brain
People say that I'm going insane
Because the life that I chose underneath the concrete
Deep where the dead sleep and the killers reap
Away from the sun, 'cause it hurts my eyes
Like a vampire only come around at night
Brand new, fuck you
Blood sweat and tears, now it's time for me to break through
Been such an outcast in so many ways
Now it's time to clear my head and make you all amazed
Words that I speak leaves your ears infected
No need for bodyguards I'm your own protection (Bring it on!)
There's only two things that I need
My Juggalo family and a bag from JD (What?!)

[Chorus: Anybody Killa]
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Hey!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Whoop whoop!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Yeah!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Why you wanna know about us?)

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope & Anybody Killa]
Me and ABK we be like
Hold up man, you got too many cases on your hands
Besides, if I told you, then I'd have to choke you
Chop and cut you, strangle and smoke you
Too much dirt that I can't speak on it
You think you know you don't know, I put my kids on it
If it makes you think, go ahead light a joint
'Cause you don't know, that's the point

[Chorus: Anybody Killa]
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Ha ha!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Juggalos!)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Underground!)

How Does It Feel?,Twiztid,"6 ContributorsHow Does It Feel? Lyrics[Intro]
This old time radio program was originally aired live
Long before the advent of high fidelity
As a result you may detect an occasional
Surface noise or volume drop
Due to transmission problems so common to old radio
We hope however that any variance in audio quality
Will not take away from your pleasure in listening to this
One of the all time favorite-

[Chorus: Jamie Madrox]
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to feel the way you do?
It's so decisive, and I don't care if you like or you hate me
I know you motherfuckers bound to underrate me

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Looking through the window as a thunder bolt strikes the ground
Wind blowing through the trees making irritating sounds
Like the voice in the back of my head but I'm immune
To the confines of Dracula's tomb
Nightbreed man-made Nosferat-ay
Child of the night sending shocks through your body
Fatter than Pavarotti, speak softly or back up off me
[Feline?], before I gaze in your eyes and blow your mind
Sickness, what I depicted [distorted and evicted?]
Frequently described as being Twiztid or wicked
Predicted many sights seen happening to lives
Perform on the daily in disguise
Sinister, tell the minister to bless my soul
Mama baby mind broke and went outta control
Smash the remote control through television screen
Blame it on the movie or a dream, it's all the same
Mind games leaving prodigies paralyzed
Swollen little brain mesmerized
Then he dies, left alone in a world full of hate
Body rots away while his mind incubates


[Chorus: Jamie Madrox]
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to feel the way you do?
It's so decisive, and I don't care if you like or you hate me
I know you motherfuckers bound to underrate me
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to feel the way you do?
It's so decisive, and I don't care if you like or you hate me
I know you motherfuckers bound to underrate me

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
You label me a paranoid schizophrenic
Known on this planet for two things, talking shit and automatic
Mind gets tragic on little walks through the woods
Bury you alive if I could
Mobbing through the hood with a body in the trunk
Unidentified 'cause he's known as a chump
I hear him keep talking junk in my ear, but nobody else can hear
I look around and I'm feeling weird
Palms are sweaty I'm 'bout to black out, last chance
But nothing could stop this Twiztid sprout
I'm all about mad cussin', fuck you [and the red mush?]
Me and Madrox are skull crushin'
Turning bitches to dust and when I recite you folks die
Like a creep in the night, I let your soul fly
So high that I never touch ground
Make it so your body's never found
Another Unsolved Mystery, looking for some nobody
Every single night on TV, trying to get me to see
My eyes closed and rolled back
Holding a thought deep in my mind about a carjack
Nervous breakdown in the middle of the street
People just kept moving their feet
Treated like a freak, so how am I suppose to act?
So when you see me, motherfucker, be prepared for the axe


[Chorus: Jamie Madrox]
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to feel the way you do?
It's so decisive, and I don't care if you like or you hate me
I know you motherfuckers bound to underrate me
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to feel the way you do?
It's so decisive, and I don't care if you like or you hate me
I know you motherfuckers bound to underrate me

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
We're going vampire hunting with a nine millimeter
Our souls our blessed by Mary Magdalene and Saint Peter
Eat a bit of flesh but I call it the host
Am I dead, alive, or just a ghost?
Comatose mid rate, two dollars and some change
Perfect picture of sanity but I'm feeling so insane
Got a migraine headache, my stomach hur- *record scratch*",Foo Dang,Anybody Killa

(How 'bout a birthday, fuck another funeral?)
We're only here to live one time, you know
(How 'bout a birthday, fuck another funeral?)

[Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
My homeboy's dead, he been gone three days
And now I'm with his family in a funeral parade
'Til the wake, split stories over chicken and biscuits
And I contemplate all the shit that he's missin'
It's fucked why folks die so young
I bet he had the chance to get my dry-cleaning done
Oh no here it comes, guess it's time to get the soup
Instead of the cigars 'cause my homie's wife is due
Here's what's true, there's an obituary page
With no section devoted to new lives being made
Sad to say, easy to see when you look
The birth rates decline while the death rates off the hook


[Chorus: Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J]

[Verse 2: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
Bad news, so much fuckin' bad news
What the fuck is the matter with these sad fools?
Nobody cares what they buildin' (Nah!), just what they tearin' down
It's hard time on your spine, it's heavy on your mind to carry 'round
Tell me 'bout what's comin', fuck what's goin', drama we already knowin'
Bodies fallin', whistle blowin', show me what's alive & growin'
Tell me about the trees reachin' the sunshine
Tell me about some soldiers coming home safe, just one time
Let somebody blind look around, let the deaf hear a sound
How 'bout a hidden treasure found? Spread some fuckin' pleasure round
How 'bout a birthday, fuck another funeral? Boo!
That's like two in a row too, with more to go through
Show me some white clouds, beaches with seagulls in the sky
No more white gowns, gurneys, your people are peace high
Somebody slow down, relieve some of this pressure
Let's try to focus on some positivity, so much fresher, how 'bout it?


[Chorus: Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J]
(How 'bout a birthday, fuck another funeral?)
We're only here to live one time, you know

'Til the day I die, you can label me a juggalo

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
No more funerals, no more wakes
No more eulogies, give my birthdays
It's time for first crawl, first tour, first walk
I don't wanna see no homies outlined in chalk
This year is our years, we livin' without fear
But so many folks dyin', that the future's never clear
It's cloudy & overcast with the past, it's a reminder
There's nowhere safe for you to hide 'cause death showed behind ya
And if this is God's plan, then help me understand
'Cause I'm losin' my fade in a world in atom, man
How 'bout a birthday, not a funeral possession?
We'll party 'til the lights go out, without question

Heinous,Dark Lotus,"8 ContributorsHeinous Lyrics[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I step 1, (ahh) 2, (ahh) across the creaky floor
Spill some fuckin' blood then I'm out the back door
Takin' little trinkets, fingernails and pieces of skin
It's all for my rituals of cold milk mixed with gin
Stir it together gulp it down my eyes roll back
I'm chasin' that dragon but it's more like a hatchet attack
I'm peekin' through windows pickin' out the next clueless one
My fingers dig into her throat what have I done

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
I sleep on a bed of sharpened knives and toss and turn until I bleed
I eat from the bread of chosen life a thousand ghosts alive in me
Wickedly I'm heinous everything I do is odious
I'm tired of the normalcy total terror's my focus
I notice that the knife wounds are spellin out a name
To the average mother fucker I can be a little extreme
So I take the bloody corset and then light it for the emphasis
Try to call me sick but I'm seein' a horror specialist

[Hook]
So you wanna murder this ya'll
That's right
And you wanna murder them
That's right
You should take a hit of this ya'll
Why? Once they're dead they're not comin' back


[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Death is imminent when you're on the other end
With ya skull bein' by the wrong side of the pulpit
Blood pours out from a splint up to my ankles in it
All over hammer and grip and so it slips
Discarded for the use of a rusty crowbar
To the whore of the coroner who is forever scarred
The terror I inflict is often described as heinous
My history about it spreads out to leave them nameless

[Verse 4: Monoxide Child]
Now ya shell shocked from all the blood that ya saw
Stainin' the walls and does surround you and it spreads to the halls
It's even drippin' from the ceiling inside
You get this feeling that the criminal's still creepin'
That's because I'm right behind you
Groin to gullet from your stomach to your mullet
Split ya clean like cantaloupe
And let ya neighbors know what done it
America's most wanted for crimes against humanity
Heinous and the evil is formin' the insanity

[Hook x2]
So you wanna murder this ya'll
That's right
And you wanna murder them
That's right
You should take a hit of this ya'll
Why? Once they're dead they're not comin' back


[Verse 5: Violent J]
The shit you callin' wicked is for kids and cheerleaders
This heinous shit right here is for demonous flesh eaters
It's rainin' blood in my bedroom a wet and bloody red
Snakes slither through my earholes in and out of my head
God damn it, it’s back a violent panick attack
Skitsofrantic and demoniacally I'm manic depressed
I'll stick an axe in yo chest
I'll kick some cracks in yo neck
I'll beat you into chunks like you was in a plane wreck heinously

[Hook x2]
So you wanna murder this ya'll

And you wanna murder them

Where's it at?

From Coke to Dope, gettin' it on the outta state strip
Star Trek was the stamp pass some outer space shit
Ice the bracelet, 3 karats, custom made shit
Love or hate it, had two bitches playin' day shift
Kept a cheese line, security, holdin' three nines
I'm tryin' to see mines, knowin' diesel's on the decline
Whip the work up, more than traffic, who's the first up?
See them young cats fuck wit that Crack, but be the first stuck
Too many on the same block, same talk
In fact they all probably cop from the same spot
I'm heavy in it, every car got the celli in it
Dash board Armor Alled up, cherry scented
Trees mixed wit it, different pagers every minute
Play the block smell like Issey Miyake, I'm buried in it
It's boss playin', respect the lifestyle I'm portrayin'
Play the streets wit a freak up in my loft playin'
Nickel nines, my prime young duns'll stick you blind
Told the only way to get doe is if you grind

It's funny how the Feds always knew where to go
It's our price, dope & vice, watch me blow
It's real shifty, brought fam to get ill wit me
Too many 50/50 niggas tryin' to chill wit me, build wit me
Plus my connects still hit me
What nigga? Nine on the cut, shit is crispy
What makes a man? Most y'all niggas faking y'all hand
Wrong shit up in you cake mix taking your grams
If you a hustler, do it like the hustlers do
Clientel first before you try stretchin' your stew
Big boys play for large sums
Stack up, strategize, watch the cars come
It's all a game, never get caught in the fame, or short your change
Boy is a slang for dope, girl is cocaine
You no name, knock a Ki of work in a week
Through word of mouth came the clout, now I'm hurtin' the streets

Some thugs have all the luck
While some thugs feel all the pain (You know)

Just like a motion picture, gunfire froze a nigga
Compose the liquor, caused me to stager, stumble over quicker
Duckin' low, with the .44, tryin' to bust and blow
Empty out before the Po Po come bust the show
Sobered up, knew it was beef, but over what?
Been in the cut, escapin' these streets, they cold as fuck
Tuck my chain in, rose to my feet, no time for aimin'
Back arched, all you saw was sparks, niggas blazin'
One fell, callin' for help, heard him yell
My last shell, tore through his spine, it's time to bail
It's slow motion, dust in my clothes, started boatin'
It's bizarre copin', my blood flowin' like the Arctic Ocean
Thoughts racin', hit the corner slow pacin'
No destination, it's up North a nigga facin'

If we all gonna die, I'm prepared to meet my maker
But before I touch that death bed, fam, I gotta see some paper
Keep my head to the sky, won't let no one pull us down
Do whatever it takes, cause that's the breaks
Money make this world go 'round

[Verse 2: AZ]
I pleed innocent, the love for my freedom is infinite
Thoughts was intimate, I mastered the minds, the mortal ten percent
Self Defense, incarceration couldn't help repent
Caught in commotion at the time I felt it, felt intense
Him or me, it's misery through my memory
But mentally, outcome wise I feel no sympathy
You know the streets, how some niggas could go for weeks
Rock you slow to sleep, play you for doe, now you know it's beef
Know it's deep, I live my life on the creep
Tinted Jeeps, bulletproof coupes move Mystique

Let him speak, my dog is innocent
It was my gats, this cat named Roberto, it's certain
Desert Ease in my skirt's end, let my nigga live

Hesitatin', they know the time a nigga facin'
So what's the verdict?

Some may criticize, but it's a blessin', that I'm still alive
From all the smoke lit, all the hoes hit, all the cold shit
From comin' that close gettin' my dome split
Spreaded out, so much on my mind, gotta let it out
To live, and die for a cause I feel dead with out
Check my rap sheet, no prior cases, just some tax beef
Charged with drunk drivin' once, but I was half 'sleep
Swervin', off of St. Mark's and Burgan, in a rented Suburban
I must've dozed when I was turnin'
But peep this, I'm on trial now, no sign of weakness
No secrets, just goin' to court and I'm tryin' to beat this
A new Don, another score, another new born, been too long
Here's a dick jury for y'all to chew on


[Interlude]
Order in the court, order in the court, that's contempt of court

[Refrain: Panama P.I.]
If we all gonna die, I'm prepared to meet my maker
But before I touch that death bed, fam, I gotta see some paper
Keep my head to the sky, won't let no one pull us down
Do whatever it takes, cause that's the breaks
Money make this world go 'round
If we all gonna die, I'm prepared to meet my maker
But before I touch that death bed, fam, I gotta see some paper
Keep my head to the sky, won't let no one pull us down
Do whatever it takes, cause that's the breaks
Money make this world go 'round

Shout my young New York niggas out there on that drill shit
Yeah, yeah, ayo
Yo, let me try this shit out right here

[Verse 1]
The scars of martyrs, the path of bastard seeds
Effects of absentee fathers passed on with ease
Hope the babies eat healthier, and may we get wealthier
They was not givin', we ask for forgiveness, not permission
Whole clique is each other counsellor
Holdin' sticks without a hockey puck
Can't co-sign 'em, them niggas not with us
Hop on a private jet with twеlve tenants
Right when I land, thе chopper to Manhattan is twelve minutes
I put the ""real"" in ""real nigga"", that's on my momma though
Homie, you gotta feel me from Cali out to the Calliope
Slicker than Desi Arnez on my Copa Cabana flow
In Houston with a thick one eatin' at Pappadeaux
Shit, it was written, choppin' up competition
Palms itchin', Bohemian Grove couldn't get Nas to visit
I seen both ends of the ladder, ain't see no silver platter
Fiction don't even matter, we don't act for the cameras

[Chorus]
Guess they used to the ego havin' head in the air
Hollywood gangsta, goons with 'em everywhere
I'm the opposite, smooth, not spreadin' fear
Silver spoons never fed Nasir, I'm on top and I surprise 'em
I'm on top and I surprise 'em


[Verse 2]
Velour fashions, world tour jackets
I turned to a hoarder, I don't need more baggage
Everybody lyin' telling stories backwards
Like my song ""Rewind,"" in store autographin'
To take it back in time to today, I'm smashin'
Flick out ashes, flip girls on a mattress
We get it crackin' without the attachments
Her and my heart is cold as Aspen, both of us laughin'
I put the ""New"" in ""New York,"" I'm home
All of the watches stay on the Eastern time zone
Throwin' parties whenever I'm feeling godly
White linen parties for whenever we make a million dollars
""Nas think he too good to pull up on us""
See me at a baby shower with some OGs from Corona
Sippin' liquor, takin' photos then I slid with a cougar
Coulda pulled a young love but I took who was choosin'
Esco relaxed in the hood, I ain't come with a shooter
They asked what I'm doin', they said I was already proven
Who said I'm too comfortable around on my regular shit?
You know I'm a rare nigga but ghetto as shit

[Chorus]
Guess they used to the ego havin' head in the air
Hollywood Gangsta, goons with 'em everywhere
I'm the opposite, smooth, not spreadin' fear
Silver spoons never fed Nasir, I'm on top and I surprise 'em
And I surprise 'em


[Outro]
I ain't sayin' don't have your goons with you
Uh, yeah, I'm on top, it's not surprising
And when you get a lil' older, you move different
Yeah, I'm on top and I keep rising (Rising)
Uh-huh (Early morning)
I'm on top (To the dawn and, I'm on top)

Where Ya Heart At,Mobb Deep,"26 ContributorsWhere Ya Heart At Lyrics[Intro: Prodigy]
Lets do it, dunn...
I mean, that's why I keep my mouth tight
Ain't got no words for y'all niggas, man...y'all niggas is crazy

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth, down here the pavement scorching
It's molten rock when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you
I understood, you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too, damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until I made things right
Pull out guns, exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines, ignite the pipes
And never let the daylight decieve
During the sun's hours niggas do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggas can't shoot, never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop, fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when it's bolt-locked, nigga

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Have you ever lost a loved one?
Or never understood love 'til you lost one?
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at?
Strength missing, to take losses is the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
Now lets find out where niggas hearts' at


[Verse 2: Havoc]
This is to my physical, you gone, to me you still here
I be buggin' thinking how you doin' up there
Probably watching over me, calling out my fouls
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child
I miss that ass, tell God I said, ""Pardon me""
If you're real, He'll forgive me (haha no doubt)
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down; niggas front, it's on
Ain't sweating going to jail, you better shoot me
Just lost my heart, if I die, you comin' with me
Quickly, while I'm pissy
They're just bitches that's a little too frisky, risky
On point, hope these cats is getting the point
Whisper out my name, stare but please don't point
Call me paranoid but I'm on point, close by the stash joint
Got you in my mind, I guess that's why they say love is blind

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Strength missing, we take losses, be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
You better finish what you started, dunn
If you ever lost a loved one
You'll never understand love 'til you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mine behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at?
Strength missing, to take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
Now let's find out where niggas' hearts at
Have you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love 'til you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Now where your heart at?


[Verse 3: Prodigy]
I find myself dozing off with it (guns)
Waking up every forty minutes (dunn)
Soaking wet, dripped to death in it
On top of rules, big barrels and tools get tested
And hittin' off makes my dick get erected
We all strive for a better tomorrow
But as far as today, your ass gots to pay
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

[Verse 4: Havoc]
Think about this, are you with your hands on who you running with
Some timers, player haters and dick riders
Bent niggas that be crashin' into dividers
Gettin' you into shit, got that ass tied up
Got them la'd up, got you comin' out of your vault
With no plans of giving back, live in serious debt
Your lady fucking other niggas, you a fool for her
Talking 'bout you got money, you just using her
Actually losin' her...",Love Is Love,AZ

We cook the shake, move the weight across the tri-state
Them jux niggas bring the shook up out the crook type
Special deliver, sendin' shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some shiesty New York niggas thirsty for cheddar
You shinin'? You get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keepin' these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top, kid
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
Stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like forcefield, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching, waiting for a come-up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shakin' your hand (Motherfucker)

Word life, combination to the safe, it's on
Get that loot, motherfucker, spread love when you on
The 41st got the heat for them niggas that thirst
Yes, divine nine shine, put that ass in line
Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine
My clique combine, dangerous minds done bust the outline
A half a man generatin' grands
Kid, you know how I go, only fuck with fam
That's why you're lookin' from the outside in
Wonderin' how we bubblin', hustlin', breakin' days in
Grimy motherfuckers, gettin' info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest
So I suggest change your location is best
'Cause I'm coming through army fatigue dressed
Blessed with hollow tips, yes
To burn through your dirty-ass Guess
(Yes, still shinin', still climbin')


[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Ayo, your timing was way the fuck off, what is you tryin'?
This faggot-ass cat should get clapped for even tryin'
He tried to confront me, but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science and numbers is how I live
If we ain't gettin' mathematics, somethin' got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strongarm robbery and icepicking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying? It's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate, it's on you

[Chorus]
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still climbing, still shining
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy

Word up son
I did 'cause I had to discipline that puppy, knahmsayin'?
Eatin' like he live, he ain't live, word up
Nobody can't eat if I can't, word up
If I can't eat, God, don't let nobody eat, God
You ain't live - I'll eat ya food kid
I'll take your food, it's on
It's on now.. word up (word up)

'Cause he's a halfway - thug that he portray
If you got locked that ass'd probably come home gay
Smack, blood out ya mouth (what the fuck you say?)
Break your feeble ass down ('cause you ain't in my league)

Yo, now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black?
I used to peddle crack, you never sold drugs so stop frontin'
I pushed the war button, you cold panicked
Use tools to fix ya fuckin' face like a mechanic
Dramatic, dynamic, and underhanded
You say the shit that I say, for so long I can't stand it
The God bandit, erupt like volcano
Shittin' lava, right on they armor, you blood(?) farmer
What Wha? Khazer, gato, nuto cuatro(??)
Imbalance the scales of slaughter, Iraq discipline
Open ya face, spit on the cut, pour the Henny in
Sweetpea, fuck with Popeye, get smoked properly
It ain't even got to be, handled on record
Just me and you, one on one, I'm only one
Yo, the only one, sixteen  alphabet
Your power counterfeit, fraudulent, fraudulent yo
Who's fascinated? I get highly lifted and upgraded
You playa hate it, bite me before I made it
My opposition, competition ya code scratched
Like gats without, serial numbers that don't match

Yo you weak minded, dumb deaf the nigga blinded
Left behind in, lost and found you can't find it
John the Baptist, observe, mad water
Surveillance my style, exile, feeble and fragile
Not one crew, fuck you up like we do
252 (25 to life kid) CNN will shoot right through
Set it off (what) break you off, just like a big brick
Chop that shit, mix and, contaminate it
Navigate it, 2-5 the most hated
My satellite will orbit in rap, planet's my oxygen
We poppin' it, kick through door, do-rag and moccasin
You can't stop, Lieutenant Arab
Thirsty to have what you have
Bust a new trey, Illuminati be the new age
Masquerade courageous, loud and boisterous in three stages
They try to get my dunn twist in cages
So get the word spread, spread it like love
You halfway - thug nigga, you portray
Yo I used to hang around with y'all, cover ground with y'all
Now I flip, turn around and pull the pound on y'all
Dissolve, that weak shit, you thought just revolved
Like the Earth at its axis, I got access, to map this
Pure blackness, yo attack this - blood sucker of the poor

Burn it, light it, weed it and off the liquor
While drivin' outside I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sights, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it

I ain't forget the hunger pangs
Stomach growlin' like thunder and rain
Fame calmed the savage that I once became
My status wasn't established from trying to get a name
It came from serving addicts letting automatics bang
My physical form grew stronger in a Riker's Island cage
Only to weaken so many of my people
Passed away like leaves in the wind
Or kids blowing ashes from trays
I possess the ghetto essence of that which I portray
I'm an emotional chameleon, see how I adapt to pain
Before we enjoy the sun we must first get past the rain
A lyricist similiar to Donnie Hathaway
Clearly superior to many, all I really lacked was fame
The +True Meaning+ the fact remains
My presence is felt like the Knicks when Patrick reigned
I'm living now, fuck back in the days
Does freedom have a meaning if you trapped in your ways?
I'm Queensbridge' most respected rapper

I hope this ain't a bad time, did I wake you?
I've been meaning to talk to you, come over
Take a walk with you, if you don't mind
I think its time I share thoughts with you
I thought you knew my feelings, I'm making sure you do
I'm sitting on my bed, staring at the ceiling, wishing you was here
We could just talk, while I run my fingers through your hair
I'm feeling your style, your conversation, your smile
I've been patient a while, there's no escaping denial
The waste of time, we could be spending
You told me I'm different, from the rest
And you don't even, understand why you wit him
If you love him, stay wit him, if not, don't play wit him
'Cause feelings run deep, my emotions make niggas
Do things they might regret, I don't wanna bang wit him
Over you, I suppose you knew
He ain't a killer
So I'mma let you go, think about it let me know

Sometimes I wish I never met you yo...

[Verse 2]
When I met you, I didn't sweat you
Eye contact was kinda real
You kept it concealed, your man was with you
You see my style you realize I'm official
I was a face you've never seen, with a grace of a king
I was me, and my man, Fly Tai in Fort Green
My people recognized you, and said you only moved with live dudes
And you don't let it run up inside you, time flew
We started kicking it, I'm feeling you, we intimate
And I ain't trying to let nothing interfere wit this
It's real what I feel, but it's quite complex
When you leave me, you with him
Now I'm stressed
You told me he hit you
I went for my pistol, loaded with missiles
You said ""No boo, you making it a whole different issue""
I left it alone, you kissed me
Got dressed and went home
Knowing you just saved your man, from getting his frame blown
But I'mma let you go, think about it let me know


Sometimes I wish I never met you yo...

[Verse 3]
I mean truthfully, you really need to know
Usually you say ""Cory, I don't wanna let you go""
Check it though, I know you want me
Yet reality confronts me, you in a situation
You know that, I must leave
In order for you to grow, try to accept this
You say I'm wrong, but in time you'll respect it
Your needs are being met, your minds in neglected
It's wrong what we doing, if not you would of left him
You telling me this is something you don't wanna hear
But you the type of woman that I don't wanna share, you rare

They accuse the righteous people of crimes and claim that we're wicked
Stirring up controversy, making us fight each other
All the fake rappers make it worse, they gotta pay

[Verse 1: Guru]
First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven twenty-one, eighteen twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Stepping up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial like saccharin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lacking in
Concepts you bite, cause your identity ain't tight
Trying to be something you're not, like pulling a knife at a gunfight
I'm trooping on night air like flight number 106
And getting all up in your fucking mix
You got me upset, and I got you uptight
Cause my committee's in your city tonight, aight?
We got seventeen million of us plus, two million Indians
That makes 19 mil, lighting shit up like Wild Bill
I be the, supreme father plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the Teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit before you walk to me, or talk to me
Stepping to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearing tracks out the frame
You know my fucking name, I rule all game
I'm universal on all planes, what's your claim?


[Verse 2: Guru]
Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous trooper, verbal nigga with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer then I blast you
Slice precise like Benihana's when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the god
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep in my backyard
I laugh hard, while your mental I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks, want to enter this rap scene
Kicking Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion, the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fucking barber
So what you made some dough, you best keep on scrambling
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handling
Demanding that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

[Verse 3: Krumb Snatcha]
I see myself as the black rap messiah
Colossal spreading my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom dick and jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Something ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love to few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut I got to stay noid-ed
Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black talking bout how much his mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes being made
No wack shit being played no fake macks getting paid
No Versace mc's, with a mouth full of mo'
Soundin' like a ho spittin' at a fashion show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap through a maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Going deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with turban, robe and sandals like Moses
Travelling high sands and eastern lands for the answers
Ignorance is spreading through the streets like it was cancer
Too many drinking not thinking, when behind that trigger
A .38 escalate the murder rate, for us niggas
It's like, microphone roulette cause nowadays MCs is getting wet
Over someone else's fake gangsta rep",Sunshine,AZ
The Mall,Gang Starr,"32 ContributorsThe Mall Lyrics[Chorus]
Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""
Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

[Verse 1: Shiggy Sha]
Yo, what the deal, cousin? Gave him a pound, now we huggin'
In the mall thuggin', buggin', spent a few hundred
Shorties must be lovin', shit, jigg to my Wallow's
They watch like Movado so I floss like a model
You ain't loungin', 'til you've been countin' by the thousands
Profilin', pushin' more weight than your medallion
We be wildin', lockin blocks down just like the Island
Dough pilin', we keeps it in the family like Italians
Ballin', cop some Charles Jordan and some Icebergs
Ice, herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Ann Taylor
He got to be, but you hot to me — you under lock and key?
Laid it down properly, this cat at Stern's watchin me
Moved on me sloppily, prepare for the fallout
With gats to blow the wall out, clear the mall out


[Chorus]
Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

[Verse 2: G. Dep]
Yo, don't be mad at me, I used to be
King Raggedy, fiends naggin' me — shit, I had to breathe
Gradually, rocked casually, Sha passed the leaf
Vaseline slick shit, green stick shit
Honey got some mean lipstick, my knot's this thick
And I cop the meanest shit, still rock Discus
But cops frisk us, the block whispers
Theft need to stop, how we cop
But you can Guess like them jeans you rock
But now I'm rollin' right, 'cause I had four faces
Fightin' four cases in them North Face and Dolomites
So with these here Isotoners, I'ma hold it tight
Shorty lookin' innocent there, in Benetton gear
Nuttin' innocent here, this Henderson gear
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party? Yeah is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre — trust me
And I'm lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snuggly fitted, rugby hittin'
Fitted and my Coogi knitted, compliments on the doobie did it
Got the movie rented if your crew be with it, yo


[Chorus]
Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

[Verse 3: Guru]
Most times I'm casual, but easily I switch
To some fly shit, like some silk suits by Paul Smith
And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole
Cop a Hilfiger, or Polo goose, for when it's cold
Armani, and Gaultier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm baggin' up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whisperin' mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see 'em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent, Issey Miyake
All the way from Green Acres to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Sonia Rykiel sweet for my girl
Stylin', on the cell phone smilin', it's my world
Can't forget the Avirex, pocket for the royalty checks
My crew be showin' loyalty, plus utmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer them bimbos, while I get some Timbo's
Later on that night you'll find them nymphos
That's how it goes cause mad heads be in the mall
Let's breeze, we got a show, plus I got another phone call",Sunshine,AZ

Yo, Redman a OG in the game, boy, I still got it
A bad MF like Samuel L. wallet (Ow)
I go postal out a Cadillac
Hit 'em with the un-positive K, I ain't havin' that
I flip modes and rampage your zip codes
Out a trench coat, I'm heavier than Klitzchko (Ha)
The hemp smoke be my first love
I stayed around that purp, nigga, like Wendy and Lisa
Yeah, in '89, I sold grams (How much, nigga?)
And now, I sign women implants (Yeah)
Doc keep a attitude, hate him or like him
Wolf tickets can't be sold, I'm half lycan
I do what I want on the regular
I get bread, get head, et cetera, et cetеra

A big difference like Bompton and Compton
Now everybody wanna light the blunt with me (Ow)
You steal my lighter, you gon' get a buck fifty (Haha)

Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize, bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live, it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it, like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it, light it, weed it and off the liquor
While drivin' outside I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sights, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest

We put this on the soul of our born, as we hold the Qur'an
Kamikaze style, older cats coaching us on
Yo, it's kill or be killed
Understand, real'll be real
A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel
Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield
And fuck a drop 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
Close the book
Was taught never expose a crook
Between the knight and the bishop
One'll knock ya rook
I'm a rare breed, never had a fear to lead
I ain't like niggas with sight, too impaired to read
We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's a target?
Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers

I'm Your Man,AZ,"5 ContributorsI’m Your Man / Feel Good Lyrics[Hook]
If you wanna feel good
I'm your man

[Verse 1]
Glorified as the most high, streets respect
16 years deep, got a sweet connect
Turned over a new leaf, no longer beef for rep
Rather burn blunts, see them fat forces relate
Learned from those that lost their estates
Attorney fees and a greedy judge, throw some a break, I'm trying to get it
And live it how the Carnegies did it, divide, conquer
Cross eyes and then launching my business, it's brain power
We bagging up the same hour
Them high decks 747s collapsed them towers - the streets need me
My advice is to breathe easy
Cause for the dough niggas can't leave me - I'm too established
Cars with the trick gadgets
Automatic show stopper, seize the no static
Bases is loaded
Through the deck, I'm in the place of the oldest
Calling the shots, 'til I'm knocked or facing my grosses
Get it right

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
The green leaf causes sounds of the sirens to seize
It's so simple, psychologically my mind is at peace
It's all mental, philosopical I sound when I speak
Show potential, been doing this since nine in the streets
Don't destruct, how to back hard, the shoulders is up
Holding a dutch, in the mix moving low as a fuck
Cash related, it's digital, don't mask my favorite
When it's critical, no time to act courageous
Guns' bust, mother cries, son's been touched
Homocide, search the hood, trying to sum shit up
The sequel, second half of the lowest lethal
You lose, double life, chair, or the needle
I'm for the peoples, the best been at war with the worst
A few squeeze through, others just dissolve in the dirt
The nod, for chance really ever to shine
So now you know why a nigga grind (grinding!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I put aside all my personal probs
Cause misconception can cause it where it hurts you inside
It's no healing, it's hard not to grow feelings
Of some sort of respect, when you coke dealing amongst men
The truth is we all want in by any means
And it seems for that American dream we all fiends
Finagle 'til we stand stable, solidify
Making plans at the grand table, God be with me
Knowing that the Mars is against me
So the stars and them tarot cards are studied intensely, time's ticking
The wise take time to listen, do the knowledge
I speak from a high position, passive or clever
Here since Jurassic era
Absorb cues from a school that'll last forever
My desire, to bake stack and reach higher
And remain in the game as a empire - we all want it

It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic

Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?

If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

Top of the world is what I'm aimin' at
These niggas is flamin' gats at my circle
I catch you, my first reaction's to hurt you; I'll hit your bird, too
Two in your scalp, then you out, your thug crew is out
Blood oozin' out, some servin' caine
Knowin' nothin' about this murder game
It's easily told but hard to hear
When niggas finally find out it's real
That's when they heart pumps fear
The real remain, the weak will disappear
My words are 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear
911 style sits on your mind like chrome
Let's say your brain's a V12, put it in drive, let it roam
What color? Might as well make it the same as your dome
You need your thoughts together means destination is unknown
As we travel on this road, an infinite path
I get into this math, drop and get intense for the cash
Will I be subject to kill? Live my life by the gat?
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back, what?

Try to give you dap just to stare at your pockets
Crews advance, nothin' new, just the rules of the land

Cops pullin' it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, 'til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?


[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
And black guns, stack ones yo
Can I live, for all my chicks pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like a bulldog, know what I mean, huh?
Can I live, to all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll, heads, yo
Can I live, to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight, niggas

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got the Feds sending me letters, 'cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down, 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given
Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo there's money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit
What you want nigga? What you want nigga?
What you want, what you want nigga?


[Outro: Jay-Z]
Can I live...
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat
Trying to win with the construction Timbs yo
Can I live...
Yo USA, all my chicks that strip
Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams
Two kids, one job, and no man
All my chicks getting that washing set with their welfare check
Haha, all the mamis dame un beso, alright
All my niggas rocking them fitted caps
Trying to get at this rap, know what I mean
All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no license

Sorry boys
But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy
Always knew I'd make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
The last of the real hustlers, well, maybe not the last
Bleek's gonna be a good rapper
New, improved Jay-Z -- I quit
I'm retiring, ain't enough money in this game to keep me around
Sorry Big, I tried, honest
Can't go with me on this ride though, I'm calling the shots

[Verse: Memphis Bleek]
Nah this ain't Jigga, it's your lil nigga Bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street
Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With 28 grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey D's
First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJ's
Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that owe me cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense, who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to come up on y'all, get one up on y'all
That's why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustling brought a living room set
Went to Tom D's, niggas mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out
Flashy, fly little nigga
Nosy bitch from the third floor like ""Why little nigga?""
Bitch please, twist the trees
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life's like cancer
And I'm serious

Amidst trading abuse… Read More [Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib & Salaam]

[Intro: Guy]
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happened when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black women
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

[Chorus: Guy and (Nas)]
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby


[Verse 2: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet, the cuter version, yet, I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself, and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, we got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, then later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life, of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what...

[Chorus: Guy and (Nas)]
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) Forever
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby


[Verse 3: Nas]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition?
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was suckers, cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even a lie
At least I can say I tried, plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again, it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

[Chorus: Guy and (Nas)]
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby


[Outro: Guy]
Gimme the key back, baby
I want your love back, baby, oh
Gimme the key back, baby, oh
'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye",Hey AZ,AZ

A lot of niggas are jealous of Buckshot (say what?)

Yeah motherfucker, thugadon till I drop
And what not, watch the spot get blown
Two heads flown, can't stop me now motherfucker
I'm in the zone
Baby you ready to go home, cuz I'm ready to bone
The don king of rap sitting on the throne
Juice truck, who's that? That's Buck
Representing N.Y.C., nigga, it got to be

Strong arm them niggas with shanks
You better thank God, motherfucker, times is hard
Real niggas know shit stink

[Verse 2: Buckshot]

I give it to you in a form a liquid you can drink too, think too
Got a mink too, platinum too
Buck is like a tank, and I'ma flat them too
Get that bitch talk, I put a cap in her too
Put the gat inside her mouth and put a gap in her too
What the dilly yo? I'm in it for the women and the profit

Much Too Much,Gang Starr,"3 ContributorsMuch Too Much Lyrics[Verse 1: Guru]
Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their P's and Q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cash flow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist and now the main attraction
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

[Chorus: Guru]
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

[Verse 2: Guru]
Check the G-U-R-U, yes, the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
Kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
'Cause I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I'm much too much


[Chorus: Guru]
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
Yeah, I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much
I'm much too much

[Verse 3: Guru]
I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'Cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm ain't buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much


[Chorus: Guru]
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much

California indo, kush bag in the rental
I was selling izzo’s, niggas was playing Nintendo
My girls all spoiled, crazy things they ask me
And when I tell them no, they have temper tantrums
If you don't see me shining, then you need some glasses
Sorry, girlfriend, but your man's a has-been
That's costume jewelry that your man is wearing
It's old, not shining 'cause them ain't diamonds
Money like Yao Ming, pulled up in that red thing
Killed the parking lot, leave it just like a crime scene
Just stop it, Gucci bags, shoes and the wallet
Lions, tigers, bears in my hood and in my closet

I ain't answer my FaceTime so this bitch try to tango
And I know that I'm a rapper, I still got them thangs on me
Spilled her drink on me, I slapped her 'cause I had to change clothes
Hear the cops comin'
Had to smoke a nigga 'cause he a lame, I'm not one
Why you think I bought this double trigger? I'ma spark somethin'
Tadoe off that molly, tryna pop somethin'
Try to take my jewelry, you'll get shot up

You talked about me bad but what you doin
Nothin but walkin round tha projects shoo-shooing
Get mad when I flash tha karats don't want to see me have it
I guess tomorrow I'll be smokin a 'gar in Paris

Beeper blowin up, I'm lookin down at tha game
I'm steady changin cars so tha feds won't mess wit me
Park tha Q 4-5 and hop in tha Cherokee
At about 8:30 I'll be rollin in a millennium
Sippin on condact on my way to my condominium
Been rollin livin lavish, eatin in commanders palace

Where niggas is chillin, sleepin in tha Royal Senesta

But if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it

If I got nine slugs, nine bullets gon' fly
If I got a red beam, nine people gon' die
Nine mamas gon' cry, nine spirits in the sky
Nine preachers preachin' nine sermons, tellin' nine lies
'Cause each and every one of y'all nine niggas wasn't shit
I would've rather kept the nine Ruger's in the Ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the nine let nine spit
I lick 'em all like eighteen tits on nine chicks
I'm a suicide risk, nine slits on each wrist
If I die nine times the next go-around's a bitch
And if I come back I'll throw 99 shows
And shove nine inches of dick in 99 hoes y'all (Yeah)

[Chorus: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
But if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
But if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it, ayy

Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me

Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa, I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock yo' whole block up

Illa-fo-reala my nilla deal another card

So quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so kill it skillet

I see y'all at the crossroads
Meet y'all in gangster's paradise
S.I.P. to all my fallen soldiers
I'm gonna miss nobody, but we still pourin' liquor (Hitmaka)
Jomo

[Chorus: Ron E & Jim Jones]
This for all my dogs, they can't break me down (Beat that odds)
I go 'Rari or the Lamb' when I'm in the town (Skrrt, skrrt)
Watch my friends turn to enemies, I'm running out (Damn)
All this blood on my hands, pray I'll make it out (East side)

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
This shit get deep in the rap, feeling like they stole my identity
I just be speaking the facts, they want my soul and my energy (My truth)
And that's crazy, if I call you my bro, you ain't got to be no kin to me (What's up, bro?)
Just for that, I'ma go drop-top Rolls like the Kennedys (Skrrt), and shit
I hear niggas talking crazy like they made Jim (Nigga, number one)
Like they was up them long nights in the Days Inn (Where you was at?)
I know life's not promised, so at them nights, I get to praisin' (Amen)
I was on the block, so I could have been standing next to Light when they sprayed him, damn (R.I.P. Light)
When the ship sank, I had to show them I could stay afloat (Got my own boat)
These niggas had to play sports, all my niggas had to play with coke
You got to stand on your business, that's my favorite quote
Chicken sandwich, you would make the toast, we ain't have much, but we made the most (Remember that?)


[Chorus: Ron E & Jim Jones]
This for all my dogs, they can't break me down (Uh-uh)
I go 'Rari or the Lamb' when I'm in the town (Skrrt)
Watch my friends turn to enemies, I'm running out (I still love 'em)
All this blood on my hands, pray I'll make it out (East side, two-door)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Uh, I guess it's safe to say that the gloves is off (So what we doin'?)
And no matter what happens, I want you to know that no love is lost (None at all)
That don't make you a good leader just because you was the boss (I'm just sayin', though)
I pray we can find a way 'cause right now, we like two brothers lost (Shh, Cain and Abel)
I kept it tall when I was in the public eye (Facts)
I'm just tryna live now, so I had to let all my grudges die (Listen to me)
We done lost so many niggas, I wish that I could just hug the sky
I could take it back to '97, on that day you know that Blood had died, shit (R.I.P.)
That's why I got it tatted on my arm (Yeah)
We better spend that money now 'cause that shit ain't gon' matter when we gone (It's a matter of time)
Don't worry about the rain, just worry about how you gon' weather the storm
'Cause when it's your time to shine, you got to be ready to perform ('Form)
I work better when I got my back against the wall (That's a fact)
I'm still setting them trends, had to put some more plaques against my wall (R.I.P. Takeoff)
But when you playin' in this game, you gon' have some accidents when you fall (Ah)
But I got strong and I made it back off the bench just so I could ball

[Chorus: Ron E & Jim Jones]
This for all my dogs, they can't break me down (Uh-uh)
I go 'Rari or the Lamb' when I'm in the town (Skrrt)
Watch my friends turn to enemies, I'm running out (I still love 'em)
All this blood on my hands, pray I'll make it out (East side)


[Outro: Jim Jones]
I just pray I make it out, that was the only mission we had
It's my grandmama house, she named me Jomo, you heard?
It's a spiritual thing

So, Lil Wayne, what's your motivation?
Is that really a question? (Yeah, shawty)
Do you really have that written down in your notepad? (You already)
You should be ashamed of yourself (C2)
You smell me, girl, I smell like money (Why not? What's better?)
See, that's what they don't understand (Not a goddamn thing)
To me, it was always get money or die (Yeah)
I come up under Birdman, the Number One Stunna, you know what I mean?
I'm Stunna Jr. (Yeah), and that's all I know, that's all I ever knew
Get money or get nothing, you know what I'm saying? (I feel)
And I feel that way (I feel it), for real

So hard I go, I keep pushing (Yeah)
The game so crazy, I'm in it like deep pussy (Yeah)

Used to make a thousand dollars every time I played hooky (Yeah)
Dwayne Carter absent, keep lookin' (Bitch)
I'm present on the block, I'm a legend on the block (Yeah)
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga, I done dropped one-eleven on the watch (Uh)
So watch and see what I do (Yeah, yeah)
Breeze by you so fast, got you sneezin', hachoo

Sick nigga, bitch, I spit that leukemia (Bitch)
Yeah, no cure, no help
So me, so good, so hard, so felt
Feel me


[Interlude]
And that's just my point right there
That's what I'm always trying to stress, know what I'm saying?
If you don't understand me, if you don't feel me, then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me, you know?
So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?
I mean, I would say the voice of the hood 'cause that's who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean? My family, that's who I represent
My homies (Yeah), my girl, my life, you know?

[Verse 2]
C'mon, bang this shit, nigga, pump my shit (Yeah)
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch (Yeah)
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch (Yeah)
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit
Like motherfuck them niggas, what they wan' do? I'm ready
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo (Yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with the boy, baby, that's a gamble  (Yeah)
If he won in Vegas, leave him on the crap table (Come on)
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable (Yeah)
Like nobody make a sound, where the paper? Where the paper?
Gotta get it, gotta have it (Yeah), once I got it, I'ma spend it (Yeah)
Then it's back to doing any damn thing just to get it (Yeah)
The re-ups be like birthday parties (Huh?)
No room to park the cars in the garages (Huh?)
So outside the cribs, all you see is 'Erraris
If I ain't say it right, fuck it, I ain't foreign

[Interlude]
And see, that's where everybody gettin' me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, for real
Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?
That's because they ain't got that heat rock like me, you know what I mean?
They ain't spitting like me
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds
I got the flu over here, man (Yeah), for real
I need relief
Y'all help me, for real (Yeah)
I know y'all sick of me, 'cause I'm tired of y'all, for real

[Verse 3]
And based on the bank, I'm doin' much better than a lot of these niggas
I'm tired of these niggas
Yawnin' when I see 'em, make me stretch and pull the burner (Yeah)
I'm cockin' back and passin'
They catch 'em in they sternum
Ooh-ooh, that gon' probably burn ya (Yeah)
That gon' probably learn ya (Yeah)
To never, ever, ever (What?)
Ever, ever, ever come around here no more
Rich gangsters over here, you gotta die with the broke bitch
I'm the god, I should ride with the Pope
But the boy so hood, I just ride with my ho (Yeah)
Yeah, and tell her 'bout Hollygrove
Tell her 'bout my last show, tell her 'bout my last ho

I play the bullshit from the backseat, champ
Yeah, I'm in the backseat, still got the seat back
Feet back, stay from where the fake be at
Niggas snitch for the shine, where the patience at?
Nigga make his own brother face his back
Give love, then take it back
Good grief, man, this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack, you know the story, snakes eat rats
Face the facts, you can't change him
Can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him, if he kill you, then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade 'em
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save you
Me, I come out of that water like I was just bathin'
And watch my step on the wet pavement, yeah
I'm from the hood, so I rep 'em where I can't take 'em
""Hollygrove, Hollygrove,"" was his last statement
So nigga, get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me W-E-E-crooked letter-Y, I'm so high
I skeet-skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine
Street-sweeper in the back of the hatch, make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in your speakers from the chopper blast
Like, haha, ah
That's bullet holes in your sneakers, got you hoppin' back
It all stop when they hit you in your top and back
No cockin' back, silly motherfucker, you ain't heard 'bout this
The clips hang down to the dick
That's an automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
When I hit every piece of your visible body, he leakin'
Mortimer is no longer leapin', he's sleepin'
While you pussy niggas is sleepin', I'm thinkin'
Deep in thought, the boy ain't even winkin'
Bob Marley got me stinkin'
Stackin' figures, I'm standing firm, life's a Slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins
From where I came
Though I bear a name only one can live with
Coach, they won't knock me off my pivot, forget it
I'm sicker with it, pick a city, buy a condo
Find a fine ho, let some time go, chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo about dough? Nothing
Man, the four-wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank top, pocket fan
No pocketknife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat-tat, tat, tat-tat-t-tat-tat, boom
Haha, tonight, I might just boost my feature price
'Cause to each his own, and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house, Big Mama's house
She told me to shoot you right after I knock you out
And he ain't gettin' up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot
Hold up, the beat might drop

Got a pretty girl Patrice, found out I'm fuckin' her niece
She tried to stab her, so I grabbed her and we called the police
Mister officer (Officer), the bitch done lost it, bruh (Lost it, bruh)

And I don't think twice or blink 'cause I'm focused

The block is hot, the cops is swarmin' a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin', with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like spazzes, come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell on a Tuesday this month, oh, sweet thang
Plus, it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament, I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin' to get this dope continuous
Ball 'til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin' to fall
Want everybody numb like anbesol

[Verse 2]
I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin'
Hem gangstas doin' time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me, I guarantee your mams be missin'
With a note behind demandin' three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist it because lil' man is trippin'
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
'Cause I'ma ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin' sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night, to your surprise, I'm here with Tec's
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fitted
Be on the block until them souljas hit it

All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin' in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin', shit is boomin'
The hottest D in town lookin' for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin' qp's to ki's
Gangin' in the cheese, them bricks is comin'
No droughts, I don't sit on nothin'
I don't believe I'm frontin'
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money being made from drugs, I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay 'em a visit
That's when ya heard....

3 Chainz, oww

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’? Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the SWAT is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say, ""Don't ask me nothing""
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It’s gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble


[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I’m back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine, turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like, ""Hi, officer""
When he ask me why I was swerving, ""I’m high, officer""

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album


[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah

[Verse 8: 2 Chainz]
I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches

I'm dealing with a lot of problems, don't know if y'all can relate
Feeling like Rod Wave, I got a lot on my plate
And I can really use a stress reliever
'Cause where I'm from, they catchin' bullets like the best receivers
The chopper's singin' like Justin Bieber
The most effective leaders have closed mouths and open ears
Likе the Nile, I can flow for years
I rеally got my own sneaker, used to shop at Sears
Rap niggas lying through their teeth, though, these are not veneers
Skipping through the airport, but soon will hop on Lears
I conquer fears, running up them Ms and dry my mama tears
I love Jim Carrey, but don't fuck with yes-men
I need honest ears when in the studio
Turned down a movie role to finish the album, I pray the outcome is good
Clayton Bigsby, y'all done took a nigga out of the hood
Carrying water, chopping the wood
But you gon' always have motion if the product is good
Lord knows it's crazy how I can just text Hov
And run plays on the weekend, it's more than just XOs
When I dropped my first album, was nervous, my chest froze
Plans gon' be executed like niggas on death row
Bought a new fuckin' crib, but that shit is in escrow
'Cause my credit score low as my self-esteem, but I grow
It's a yellow beam when I glow, I have mellow dreams when I smoke
To my fellow kings, keep the hope, I thank Elohim that I woke up this morning
Acting wild like a Black & Mild, we smoked the opponent
I prayed and hoped for this moment, and if I post it, I own it
No cap for me, we get money like athletes
Like the eighth man on the Wizards, that's more of a match for me
If we being completely honest, me and the mic got chemistry
Boy, I got this down to a science, I promise you, I ain't lyin'
Get love in every borough, my niggas are very thorough
Wish a nigga would like Timmy, bro, send 'em to Fairy World
Never wore a Jheri curl like Mike Jack in the 80s
I might crash the Mercedes, my life flashed from a baby
I reminisce on the daily, my penmanship which had pay me
It's time to get the bacon, this shit is biscuits and gravy
Time to break fast, to keep it real, how long the fake last?
New year, same goals, stay out the way and make cash, huh
The competition, damn, we way passed
I need more real love and less fake laughs, huh

I wear this mean mug like a face mask
She give me real love with that fake ass
It fit me like a glove, OJ hands
I'ma need a little love from your hatin' ass
Real love, real love, Mary J. playin'
Need less yes-men and more amens
I'ma need more real prayers and less praying hands
I'm smoking straight gas, no brake pads
You smokin' Bubba Dub, nigga, straight trash
I get more camel toe than them Arabs
She deep throat the whole dick, but couldn't take half
I take a nigga life before he take the stand
Take some drugs then take off, take some when I land
You standing on business, I'm a businessman
I'm a goat, nigga, you a sacrificial lamb
You a teddy bear, nigga, you a Teddy Graham
You sweet as jelly-jam, honey glazed deli ham
Bubblegum candy yams, my gun never jam
I got a heavy hand, but hold it like a Steadicam
Am I talking to the martians when I pray, man?
I need to know is there a heaven or just Space Jam?
And it's Saturday morning every day, man
Young Carter and Cordae, man, all day, man
Why they playin'?
Elvis has left the building, went to Graceland
And if it ain't a red flag, then it's a red flag
And if it ain't Mula Baby, then I ain't the dad

Standing at the bus stop
I heard a voice behind me saying: ""Hi, baby""
Ohh, I just fell all apart inside
Because I hadn't heard that voice in such a long time
I turned around...

[Ghostface talking over sample]
That's right y'all... y'all shoulda seen what I did
So so pretty, so pretty... (Y'all hear how she sounds, right?!?)
(She sounds crazy, right?! Yes!)
This what happened at the bus stop...

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
She turned around and this grown lady said ""Hi""
I was quite stunned from the way she replied
""Peace, nice to meet ya, sweetie, call me Toney Starks
Ghost if you like ta – mind if I invite ya
Over for some red wine, nice Barry White, huh?""
She pulled out a cigarette, ""Hon, here's a lighter""
Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink
Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek
When she spoke (""Hi..."")
Her smoke floated when it left her throat
Spelled ""honey,"" when she blew it, out it turned to water, word
I was infatuated
She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it
Plus, the bottle was nickel plated
It make a young girl steez, yo, feel outdated
And older married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybelline
Cover Girl lipstick, Plumb color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-5-6 shit
The ashes was hangin off her stog', so she flicked it
Damn, had to bundle up, I caught goosebumps
Plus the windchill factor had dropped
Here the bus come (""Yo, here the bus come!"")
I never rush one, ""Here, take my number, miss, I live alone...""
Her face fell when I dropped the chrome {*gun hits the  ground*}

Picture me snotty nose, sittin on my aunt's lap
The kid like 5 or 6, shit, I would curse back
I got it from the older folks, sittin in the living room
Everybody had cups Stylistics song, boom
But then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up
Baby caught a contact, I'm trying to tie my sneaker up
I'm missing all the loops, strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good, the joke's on me
I heard a voice, ""Get in the room!"" I get angry
Stomp my feet, catch a tantrum
Spit, scream, ""Fuck that!""
Mom would shake me real hard, then get the big gat
That's called the belt, held me as I yelled
I'm in the room like ""Huhn, huhn, huhn,"" with mad welps
Ragged out, bad belt – yes, her presence was felt
Then get my black ass in the bed, it's time crash out, pass out

Despite the alcohol, I had a great old mama
She famous for her slaps, and to this day she's honored
But when I was a lil' dude, her son was a lil' rude
I'd pluck the peas off my plate and pour juice in a nigga food
Get beat, then I'd run, tell grandma, ""My mama hit me for no reason!""
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin'
And felt that belt stingin when I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start crying, when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake Pro-Keds
In the corner, weavin' and screamin', trying to block my head (""AahHH!"")
Nowadays, kids don't get beat, they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks, punishment's like ""Have a seat""
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
And bring you to your momma, yo, she got the switch in the stash
That's back to back beatings

Woke up this morning hearing shots below my project window
The TV's on from playing all night on Nintendo
Jump out of bed, tryna to see what's up with all the noise and
I see somebody else has caught a case of lead poisonin'
This type of shit around my way's a regular occurrence
Because the same shit just happened to my nigga Terrence
A week later now, somebody else is laying dying
Surrounded by a crowd of people and his momma crying
The way he's laying there, it looks to me like duke's a goner
I seen the cats who just did it run around the corner
I start to wonder who it is and why they had to wet him
I bet I knew him, or at least, I bet I probably met him
I can't pretend that I'm shocked like electrocution
'Cause any night, there could be an execution
My momma told me that that thug shit'll get you buried
The next day, there's your name in the obituary
I asked her, ""Why we gotta live in this environment?""
She said, ""Your grandfather drank up his retirement
Plus when I fucked around and had you, I was just a baby
Just maybe, if I wasn't being miss lady
Things could've been a little bit better""
Threw on my jeans and my double knit sweater
I hit the block tryna find out who got done in
Who had the gun and who that was I seen running


[Chorus]
Another body on the ground, cold; and
Another day, another lost soul; and
Same shit in every zip code
No matter where you go
Its just another block episode
Another story on the street told; and
Another turn down the wrong road; and
Sit back and watch it unfold
Yo, I'll let you know
Just another block episode
[Verse 2: Punchline]
Yo, I roam the streets with my peeps and a gun by my crotch
I got beef with this cat that resides on my block
He getting popped - I swear, when I see him, it's on
He'll just be a tattoo on his best friend's arm
My friends screaming, ""Punch, be calm""; y'all can save it
He borrowed five Gs two months ago, still ain't pay it
This girl hit me on the cell about his location
I grabbed my gun, jumped in the hoopty, then I started racing
Turned out the lights a block away so he don't peep the caper
I see him and a bunch of cats by the bodega
Don't wanna kill him, I just wanna teach this cat a lesson
Stepped on the gas, grabbed the gun, cocked back the weapon
Shot up the whole corner, but hit him in the kneecap
That's cool, 'cause dead niggas can't pay your cash back
I'm nuttin' to laugh at, I keep a bad temper
I hit him, a bystander, and one of his crewmembers
(gunshot)


[Verse 3: Wordsworth]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Last thing I heard was a blast, car circling past
I wasn't nervous, thought they might be searching for gas
Soon as Rob came out dispersing the trash
Car sped, and lead went through his windows, curtains and glass
Dove in the dirt and the grass
I look - bullet struck my right arm
Glass in my left palm, I lost my neck charm
I knew it was Punch, 'cause Rob owed him money
But never had it, always got new kicks and gear to match it
I'm in the ambulance, I thought that beef was squashed
That's why when he seen Punch he crossed the street and dodged
See Rob's records with the DA is forfeit
My records 4.0 GPA, going to Harvard
Athlete's a hundred miles and running, he's a convict
Other hand, my high school football team, I lead in yardage
Boys, regardless - blood pressure drop, artery vessel clogs
Cardiac arrest, next my chest was shocked, IV
Oxygen mask, bleeding heavily
We need to get to the hospital fast; I'm doing 70!
Why I gotta be a causality of war? Did good most my life
My career was growing gradually and more
Hearing, ""Hold on, you'll be alright, you're gonna make it""
Sirens up ahead, construction on the pavement
Slowed down - from this moment, I didn't have a chance
Seein' hazards flash, can't believe I died in a traffic jam

Cold World,GZA/Genius,"98 ContributorsCold World Lyrics[Intro: sample]
""I had a bad dream""
""Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams""
""What a time you chose to be born""
[Chorus: Life]
Babies cryin', brothers dyin' and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked
Down in this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fuckin' projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a TEC
Outsiders were stuck by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods rob and snipe what’s new in sight, fuck blue and white!
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your 52 handblocks was useless
Linx was snatched off necks, there's scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel, made 'em fold and squeal
Once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his farmers
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everythin' except check stubs
And it does sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where Feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee, they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hitmen who pull out TECs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashin' checks again
Back to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington


[Chorus: Life]
Babies cryin', brothers dyin' and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (Cold world)
We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold (Cold), cold world (Cold world)

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prix's
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips, full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the prowl broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash
Jakes on my ass, young bucks is learnin' fast
.357's and .44s
Bought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questionin' while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
'Cause niggas' main concern is cream
Some niggas in a jet-black Galant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead, but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions for portions of streets causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians tryin' to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script—I'm not an actor, but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor


[Bridge: Life]
You know, you had me
With your sensuous charm
But you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by
[Chorus: Life]
Babies cryin', brothers dyin' and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
Babies cryin', brothers dyin' and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Outro: Life]
Babies cryin', brothers dyin' and brothers gettin' knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down

Here, Pretty Toney tells a story of encountering a lovely female and doin what he does best.

Ghost… Read More [Intro]
No, man, all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know?
I keep 'em broke, wake up one morning with some money
They're subject to go crazy, you know?
I keep 'em looking good, pretty and all that, you know, but no dough
When I get a bitch, I got a bitch (Right on)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Word up
Got motherfuckin' brother wise
You know what I'm saying?
Teaching the uncivilized
Yeah, runnin' the streets, you know it's deep
Word up, check his technique, yeah
I be Ghostface
Flippin' the marvelous track
Yeah, you know the steelo
But yo, yo
Check the banging-est sounds that I invent
Fake niggas who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga with his back against the wall
Heads clocked once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin' a Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit' a switch and, yo, I had to step to her
In a manner, and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name, hon? Hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle just like glass in the sun
Never diss 'em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss 'em
Especially when you're browsin', goin' fishing
Your waistline bangin' like a bassline
Physical form is well complex, and, yo, I love your outline, boo
Your whole body is wild with your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strike out, tell me what can really go wrong
You're rocking labels, Tommy Hil' down to Claiborne
Show me some love, hon, show me some love, boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Ayo, peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freaked it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion
This shit got me open like dust and, yo, your stee is Thai potent, yo
We can go the distance, I'll put you under wings
From this convo, we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked the hot Arabian desert barefooted
I grabbed your hair, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it


[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Word up, yo, straight up and down, yo
Check the joint, baby
It be the Wu-Tang production
Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit
And brothers catchin' repercussions

See, let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Any time you pop that shit, nigga, I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know
It'll come to what? Say what?
Whether y'all from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens, nigga
I don't give a fuck where you be, motherfucker
Where you reside, motherfucker
How you live? How you see?

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth, blaow

[Verse 2: Buddha Monk]
Dirty, can you hear me? Rawness, I'm inflicting
It's that G-type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite the styles, I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

[Verse 3: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, straight out the lava by them hellfires
A known mental killer, born thriller, assassin of terror
A hot bloody fatal mixture of carbon and water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order
Start the mission, travel like the speed of wind
Through the valley of sin, I step to ville and murdered many men
Serving justice in my vicinity


[Interlude: Zu Keeper]
This is Brooklyn Zu
Za-za-za, za-za-za
Za-za-za, z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-dah-duh-duh-duh

[Verse 4: Murdoc]
I get down, I get down, I crack your fucking crown
Lay around and watch some real niggas break ground
I can't stop 'cause every bop blowing up the spot
Hit rocks and niggas know

[Verse 5: Killah Priest]
Yo, niggas grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the Zu brought me in
Now bring 'em forth like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain and make sure he can't maintain the calmness
You're harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage light now appears to be the Moon
Now your posse is your fucking platoon
Stale sound just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja once I send you cold stares
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist with the clearest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fucking mind

[Verse 6: 12 O'Clock]
Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a monk
Warning you, chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keeping powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks


[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a—

[Verse 7: Shorty Shit Stain]
Got more props than the president
My hardcore represent
Blowing niggas back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted
So you can gift-wrap the shit I'm kicking and send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it
Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'Cause niggas' rap styles just down, it's expired
You should've stayed home instead of picking up a microphone
But if you wanna run on up like you tough
I call your bluff and blow you down with my hardcore stuff
I shine like twenty-four carat, niggas know

[Verse 8: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
WZA, WZA, WZA, WZA, Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggas, you're tripping
Drugged up from sniffing, you're the one who's riffing
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Yeah, start to flip, slip 'cause you're slipping
While you sleep, I be the God on point with Scottie Pippen
As I jump on stage, flip, rip a show
Strip and rip a ho, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxing, maxing
Relaxing, sitting back, silly attraction
Again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducing one-man band in town
It's wild, more the style couldn't stand, nigga
When the jump stepped to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get dap-slapped across the MC map
Your ass, that's your ass on a whore shot
Come on through, I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudey with the Hong Kong Phoo'
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile, then I get higher


[Verse 9: 60 Second Assassin]
Here comes the ill-type rougher
Style be untouched, I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who? Who? What? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers
Keep it stainless steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills at the last of the Sam's Mill

Hit you with the blast (Yo, close the door)

""Oh, mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son""
""I agree""
""I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from""
""You know very well, it's yours too""
""Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?""
""And what have you come for?""
(Duel of the Iron Mic!)
""You come here, since you're so interested—fight me""

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, picture bloodbaths in elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow-moving MCs is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions, facial expression leaves impression
Try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts, son, here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th from Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grow on trees and there's thieving MCs
Who cutthroat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast like running rivers
I be that whiskey in your liver


[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the 52 fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
This is not an 85 affair made clear
When the gods get on to perform, storms brew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killa Beez are stinging something while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic swordplay
Poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure any contender
Testing the murderous Masta could lead to disaster
Dynamite thoughts explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing, punishing stings to the sternum?
Shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure 'em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Thugs kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
Soul Controller avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, ki's in their vaginas
No peace, yo, the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest individual
Critical thoughts, criminal-minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing


[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

""Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!""

In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost

All the niggas in the party, well, party along with me
Sing the song, sing the song with me

La-la-la-lady, tell me why, tell me so
I ask you to go high, you tell me to go low
So I go low, taste the shit
Taste it again, I like it
I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream's my specialty
When I go, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun,"" girls get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that old mad funky flow
Not sayin Ason, duck-duck disco
Or disco duck, strictly hip-hop
Baby, baby, I can't stop
Wu gots like come on through
Soo, that's the call for the Wu
I came here to rectify
Brooklyn Zu terrify
And why, niggas wanna get up and rap and rap and rap?
Man, fuck that
Hits that I make is the shit
I wanna see you up in the air, can you dig it?
Let's sing the song
Come on, party people, all in together now, sing along
Have you ever, ever, ever in your long legged life
Had a bald-headed bitch for your bald-headed wife?

Who's the baddest motherfucka in the Brooklyn town
And also representer of the Wu-Tang sound?

Last nigga got up and got shot up
But you's a gangster, on the ball-strap hanger
Fuck with the Wu-Tanger, I'll bang you
You'll get shanked and spanked and alley-ooped

Only speaks about Brooklyn Zu
That a true nigga shall come through

When it blows up in your face, you leave it alone

About any nigga or niggerette
Get burned to the ground, feel like a cigarette
Straight up and down, I get dirty to the ground

Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot

Fuck that!

Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's

Kickin' the fly clichés, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
Continue to make more hits with Rae and A

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit DOWN
As I come and freaks the sound, hardcore
But giving you more and more, like ding!
Nah shorty, get you open like six packs
Killer Bees attack, flippin what, murder one, phat tracks
A'ight? I kick it like a Nike Flight!
Word life, I get that ass raw, I'm fulla spite!
Check the method from Bedrock, 'cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, we going to war right now
So, yo, bombin
We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save ya breath before I vomit


[Verse 2: Method Man]
I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin this ho, this is MY show, tical
The FUCK you wanna do? More than Spike Lee's Do
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO style, buddha monks with the owls
So who's the fucking man? Meth-Tical
On the chessbox

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost, like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material, made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspector, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode


[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox!
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin me, you out of respect, chops ya neck
I get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'
So clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jettin like a runaway slave

[Verse 5: RZA]
Ya gettin stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels
All the meth got me open like Fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil
The pencil, I break strong winds up against your
Abbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics


[Verse 6: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Are uh-ah-uh Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurai
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS!
Niggas be gettin on my fuckin nerves
Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb

A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique DROP THAT SCIENCE

[Verse 7: GZA]
My my my
My Clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer
Style jumped off and Killa, Hill-er
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! Now it's all over
Niggas seeing pink hearts, yellow moons
Orange stars and green clovers

Word up Wu-Tang in the house though
I guess alot of people in ya
I guess they can feel the realness you
They could feel the vibe
And I think hip hop, that's what I be tellin a lot of people
A lot of record promoters and a lot of artists
I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel
You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance
But I'm pretty sure that's probably what's it like
You know you probably really get into it
I guess I hear it in your voices when you sayin the rhymes
Um, what ya say ya style is?

Ain't no– none of them niggas can't fuck with me
What? Nigga, you could never fuck with me, my nigga
I'll fuck you up right now, what? What? What?
Bust your motherfucking ass, boy

[Verse]
I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MCs looking out
I drop science like girls be dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
Ason? I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass as I create
Rhyme good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of Mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit, chk-chk, blaow
Last seen and heard, no one knows
You forget, niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing, before, you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
Then watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go below zero
Without a doubt, I never been tooken out
By a nigga who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga (Brooklyn Zoo) who couldn't figure
How to pull the fucking gun trigger, I said, ""Get the fuck out of here""
Nigga wanna get too close to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll jack any whack host
Introducing, yo, fuck that nigga's name
My hip-hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rain, it pours 'cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will rizzock the spot
MCs, I be burning, burning hot
Woah-ho-ho, let me, like, slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga, get up, act like a pig, try to hog shit
So I'll take your ass out quick
The mics, I'm had it, my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Chk-chk, blaow, blaow, blaow, blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock-knock-knock
Who's there? Another motherfucking hard rock
Slacking on your macking 'cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back (Back)

Something heroic in his manner
There's a courage about him, doesn't look like a killer
Comes across so calm
Acts like he has a dream
Full of passion
You don't trust me, huh?
Well, you know why
I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway

Thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass-heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hours, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, word life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it

Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable
Real niggas raise up, spend your money, argue
But this time is for the uninvited
Go 'head and rhyme to it, bitch nigga, mics is getting fired
More fiends, chicks be burning like chlorine
Niggas recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moët be tasting like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death, whips rolled up
You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with MAC-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son?
Do you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I'll probably wax tracks, smack rap niggas, you, facts
Niggas' lyrics are wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missiles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimum wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac'
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French, but let me speak Italian
Black stallions wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan

Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like fuck, waving they arms to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlúas on rocks
On the crack spots, rubber band wrap all my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the feds
Word up, cousin, nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it

Ayo god man, give me a cigarette
Yo here you go, here you go, here you go
Check it out, man, check out what I got here, man
What is that, what? What's that?
Yo it's a letter I got from my man Nas, man
Word is bond, yo yo
What it say, kid?

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove (One what?) One love!

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V.I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home, I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated, your mind dive
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin', ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said, ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre deuce""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could have caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryna tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love

Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage

Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh

Gettin' paid is all I expected

Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talkin'

So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter

'Cause when I lick shots them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
Three fifty-seven slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, (Yeah, nigga, peel!)
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckers know the pedi'
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm diggin' in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggas come through, I'm takin' high school rings too
Bitches get delgnarts for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed, too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

And if he start to scream, bom-bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block

Oh shit, the cops

Basically
Can't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze


[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real, yeah, uh

When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Champion (Champion)

When I will be di number one (Tical)

Mi a-go lick out dem brain (it’s like that)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll


[Interlude: Method Man]
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (Motherfucker, I'll fuckin')
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

[Outro: Method Man]
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off and feed you nothin' but sleepin' pills

One in the chamber, the safety is off, release
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doin' your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive the Q-45
Glocks and TEC's are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it!

Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh

Doin' whatever it took, from snatchin' chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Gettin' paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?!
Now I've got a Glock makin' motherfuckers duck
Shit is real and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kickin' niggas down the steps just for rep

Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talkin'
You better act like CeCe, and keep on walkin'
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin'
I'm rippin' MC's from Tallahassee to Compton

Niggas say I'm strange, deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit
Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin' shit drip

[Verse 1]
My man Inf left a TEC and a nine at my crib
Turned him self in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', ""It's so hard""
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt

Ayo god man, give me a cigarette
Yo here you go, here you go, here you go
Check it out, man, check out what I got here, man
What is that, what? What's that?
Yo it's a letter I got from my man Nas, man
Word is bond, yo yo
What it say, kid?

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove (One what?) One love!

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V.I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home, I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated, your mind dive
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin', ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said, ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre deuce""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could have caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryna tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love

Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons (Yeah, yeah)
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!
[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescence street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin', we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high

'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

I woke up early on my born day; I'm twenty, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage


[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Goin' out to the hardcore Hip-Hop
Of course we don't flip flop

[Verse 1]
If you don't know me by now, I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive, the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper – down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads, or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Wanna kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around, I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember ""You Must Learn""
About the styles I flip, and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler, or player
But make sure live, you is a dope rhyme sayer

[Verse 2]
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw, I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow, let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments
My style is toxic, when I rock and shock and Hip-Hop it
Unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it


[Chorus]
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know

[Verse 3]
Some MC's don't like the KRS, but they must respect him
'Cause they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' 'em, checkin' 'em, disrespectin' 'em
Just deckin' 'em, deckin' 'em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your T's and dot your I's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the ""Wrong Side of Da Tracks,"" electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defense mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em


[Chorus]
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know

Buggin' Out,A Tribe Called Quest,"144 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolBuggin’ Out Lyrics[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half-step cause I'm not a half-stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers' last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two-inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B 'cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged


[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying, ""Mic please""
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged


[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling an MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)

[Verse 1: AZ]
At times, I window-watch out the Marriott
Zonin' on ownin' co-ops, foreign drop-top coupes and yachts
Guzzlin' straight shots of scotch
Formulatin' up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot 'cause it's scorchin' hot
Makin' it hard tryin' to figure who's out to trap me — Pataki
Got all kinds of undercovers that's comin' at me
Perhaps he won't be happy 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be, sittin' in Coxsackie
But never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstasy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)

[AZ in background]
A-yo, son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, 'cause we spendin' the Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how we do

[Verse 2: AZ]
No more cuttin' grams and wrappin' grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seekin' for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old-timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer, and enjoy how life's supposed to treat ya
Laid in the shades of the Everglades, finally forever paid
Wearin' the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisines
I guess bein' down for so long, I'm all in-store to see my dreams

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)


[Verse 3: AZ]
So until I see past the green pasture
Me bein' supreme master, ain't much more of life I fiend after
But another chapter, a new way of life to adapt to
'Cause these streets'll gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable
Consciously aware, plus political (Political)
'Cause though they claim every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established, we eatin' lovely, livin' lavish
Like the House of Versailles in Paris, I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)

It's so crazy, I'm down with AZ
It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly

[Verse 1]
Sketch it!
Witness the relentless, the manhunt intenses
The TEC left behind was print-less
NARC's and Homicide, Feds in armored rides
Haile Selassie, I'm vest-up, armed to die
Forever will, Glock shots, shoots to kill
So what the deal? Violate, feel the steel
The cleverest, soever swifts, roamin'
The urban terrorist born with this, gettin' on with this
Makin' moves while you fake moves
You and your frontin' crews dressed
Pawnin' jewels, livin' on 6-2's
But now it's on, the end justifies the means
Lye smoke and C.R.E.A.M. is all I fiend
It's in my genes, I float through the streets and seen
In a tinted European 850 coupe, it's green
Nothin' in between, me and my team — we ill too
Respect due, oh, I feel for you!

[Verse 2]
We got this locked now! Pure official, white Cristal
The hype'll get you before the snipe from the pistol
It's potent, just one whiff'll have you floatin'
Hot and soakin' while I'm sellin', y'alls is smokin'
Forever shinin', but strictly through diamonds prominent
Dinin' with wealthy old dime bitches, riches from cosignin'
Golden-American Visa Charge-card, holdin'
I'm rollin' affiliated with those that bollin'
So knowledge me, and analyze my qualities
You've crossed all apologies, my lifetime policy
Plus playin' for keeps in these New York streets
It get deep, so hold heat and try and control your sleep

Select paper and invade all the illest niggas, tally up paid, yo

Colorful drawers, bad whores on the weekend

Fuckin' with mine or how we design, my niggas might find ya

Movin' out, colored Durangos, picture me broke
That's like picture rich niggas with the same coats
Or rich niggas with the same coke

You know how sometimes you just feel like ya
Like your back is against the wall
You might go through a particular situation or something
(Sitting here waiting for tomorrow)
It ain't gotta be jail
It could be, what you goin through in your life
Like the industry or some bullshit
So I think you need to put together
The right type of motherfuckers
You could put the realest niggas you could think of on this record
And just kick real shit, know what I'm talkin 'bout?

Thinkin of raps as spit through the cracks in the door
Learnin how to accept losses
Writin to the sound at night of the depths walkin
To the rhythm of keys jinglin, cells openin
Inmates hopin that he thinks his bail rollin in
When it's over, it's back to totin
That's for sure as, back to clappin that fo' fo' again
Popos know it's him and they know it's 'Mega too
So we roll around the city like we just as dead as you
Bet if you, threaten us nigga, then the threat is you
You know that they say restin in heaven betters you

The flow is cocaine raw, I can't feel my face
Niggas think shit's sweet 'til I give 'em a taste
Of de-feat, even Kings fear a lyrical ace
Don't make requests if we ain't friends, give me my space
You throwin stones? Kick rocks, ready y'all ain't
On my level, I'm one of the thoroughest to ever spit
With +Fire and Desire+ like Rick James, (I'm 'Mega bitch)
Don't ever shit where you sleep or you'll smell a stint
A lot of people sittin in cells from carelessness
Ruin lives and neutralize the tenements

Yo up in the game room 4 in the morning and it's storming and we blitzed
Just rocked another wig, yeah we on it
God had blood on his sweat pants
The way the tech dance on a nigga face, son ain't have a chance
Seen him, high pitch yellow nigga from outta town
A young mellow ally tryna run through
Hell, it's on called the dogs to get on him
And we caught him, only thing this nigga was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail, I used to play baseball with him
'Til he got large, son bought a whale
Azure by the entrance, guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back in the Acura
Spectacular vic, he stackular
Seen a nigga gem-down, fresh haircut tryna swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild
We walked by eyeing 'im
Shorty ain't looked he trying to get fly, my niggas ain't dived on him
Kaze had the MAC in the vest, the way he moving might be dressed
He made two rights, nigga move left
Standing by the incinerator, thank God he a generator
I can tell, bought his lady suede gators
Yo now it's time to move, spin nozzles on the tools
Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib, yup draped
We on the elevator baked, staring at the nigga chain shape
We looked at him, seen all crooked, then we flashed on him
He knew we was live, my man Boo spazzed on him
Pulled out, took off the wool, nigga cool out
Walk you out the bulding, better run nigga move out
This nigga liver than fuck, larger than fuck
Better kill me, all y'all niggas is butt, what spray it up
Tuck the chains in, Kaze shot him at point blank range then
He started screaming like a cave man
Blood got a salty taste, I can tell furniture fell out his face
Laced now it's a case
Threw up, vomit on my coat piece
Snatched all his ice now, Chrome T, boatin' off low-key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail, Mexicans surrounding the gods
Chill, you're bigger than the ocean, slow motion
Play it off no emotion but my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him
We might kill you circulate death, that's how the real do

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince 'em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD


[Verse 2: Nas]
Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me, I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black, light another blunt in fact, haha...

Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'

Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors

Run with me and I'ma make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs, we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty, I cruise through Harlem in an M3
Never pay for parties, say my name and I'm in free
I'm on some 100-G car shit, superstar shit
Sellin' niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot, I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cocked, represent one block
139, nigga, the Danger Zone
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
Yo, I'm out, I done took up enough time


[Interlude]
We out, no doubt
You know how we do
Flamboyant for life

[Chorus]
Big L, Corleone
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
Big L, for real
Corleone is too advanced for y'all
Big L, I'm a pimped-out nigga for real
Big L, Corleone is too advanced for y'all

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's Corleone and Queen's Most, we bust 'til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go, we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome, always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is how I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop frontin' ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machete, pockets heavy, slang more cane than Eddie
I represent Uno Tres Nueve
Time is money, so I stay late
I'm quick to slide a playmate, bust off like a tre-eight then vacate


[Chorus]
Big L, Corleone
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
Big L, for real
Corleone is too advanced for y'all

Check The Technique,Gang Starr,"32 ContributorsCheck the Technique Lyrics[Produced By DJ Premier]

[Verse 1]
You puny protozoa, you're so minute you didn't know the
Gang has been watchin' but instead of just squashin' you
I'm scoopin' you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist, other scientists are followin'
Plannin' to examine you on a Petri dish
Sticking you and frickin' you just a teenie bit
I'm clever with science, but never relyin'
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin'
Insisting they come off, I let 'em get some off
Then come back with drum tracks their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin', like makin' love I'll never stop thrustin'
Into your system, so just listen
I'm like a neurosurgeon, operatin' with a purer version
I write prescriptions of words that fit in
The dope gets prescribed as I kick it live
'Cause it's more than a style, it's conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak

[Verse 2]
I'm rushing you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, I then'll be breakin' you
Taxin' without askin', attractin' a snake in you
Makin' you succumb to the drums of Gang Starr
By far we are truly gifted ones, son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin'
You'll be dyin', tryin' to face the fate of your delusions
'Cause miscalculation is all you're statin'
So I'm chumpin', puntin' punks just like footballs
'Cause I wanna put y'all back in the mess hall
To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap's crazy wack, so don't try to pull that
You're lackin' the vernacular, I'm slappin' ya and cappin' ya
And closin' your jaw, 'cause you can't mess with Gang Starr

""Bon voyage"", ""Sayonara"", ""Arrivederci""
Your ass gets busted, doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me, because you copy and falsify
And I don't care how many step up, 'cause you all could try
To wish and fish for a style, here's a fishing rod
These rhymes are hittin' hard, constantly I'm gettin' large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don't sleep, but just peep me
Puttin' methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 RPMs displays the art of men
And as my rhymin' builds you see my time it's chill...
And then I look upon weak ones
I'm teachin' each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like French braids
Or tied up like corn braids, 'cause I got a strong rage
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
'Cause this ain't a slave sale and I ain't the same stale
Rapper, no, I'm not a phony microphonist with no class or
No type of real appeal or real talent
And it makes me violent, man
To see all of these peewee league MC wannabes
Making G's 'cause some dumb companies
Have lots of money but no idea of what is wack and what is dope
So check out what the Guru wrote
'Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough brain cells so I can stay paid well
Now I'm in the driver's seat, and rockin' the liver beats
Bouncin' and boomin' and blastin' you to the next seat

I'll be by your side, I'll always find a way
General, we got these niggas
Fucking cockroaches, you wanna go to war? HA-HAAAEEH!
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 1]
(By your side)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long
They can't stop me, even if my brakes was on
I'm still (by your side)
I'm always here, nobody’s perfect, life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck, I ain't always care
When it’s too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right (by your side)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right (by your side)
Where I’m supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it’s the right or the wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team (by your side)


[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 2]
As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever homie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy, right (by your side)
As soon as something happen to you
Your niggas are bouncin' and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc right (by your side)
Puttin tubes in you
And you can’t even eat right, they puttin’ food in you
Your body’s getting colder, Devil on your shoulder
And your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her (by your side)
Nothin but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and y'all under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front
At least I'm gonna be (by your side)


[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 3]
Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor: stick to our little plan
And fuck the money, just keep my little man (by your side)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he know how it's going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store, show him the loafs
Hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right (by your side)
You know Kiss
Don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be (by your side)
The answer's plenty
'Cause when you, handling business you can't be friendly
And if you, tryin to stack something can't be pennies
Most likely Grants and Benjies
And you better keep 'em (by your side)

Do she handle it like she got a deep throat?
I mean suck that cock 'til she start to choke
Does she like to have sex high off the X?

Does she like to wear thongs that you can eat?
Do she fuck your brains out 'til you fall asleep?

And I bet you she will never do, oh

Ladies and gentlemen
(Come on throw your hands in the air like this one time)
One-two, this thing on right here
(We ain't gonna stop)
Can y'all hear me out there?
(And we want everyone in this motherfucker to get up out their seat)
Ladies and gentlemen, without further adieu
(It's our time)
I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel
Who me? That's none of your concern
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs
Pussy flawless, get wetter than worms
If you only knew like Aaliyah
How your man be hawking me and stalking me
When he fucking you he see me
Every crack vial or record he sell I get a piecey
Easy, believe me, my words is credible
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die


[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Your so-called vendetta was light like bird feathers
Even with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane
I moved on to bigger and better things
Y'all still making minimum wage
First on stage, like the Ever I glazed
Leave you amazed, and keep the fifth by the rib cage
All you jealous ass hoes', rebellious ass hoes'
Still trying to recoup off the first album ass hoes'
You a gangster? Prove it. Wanna shoot me? Do it
That's word to Jerry McGuire, I'll set that ass on fire
Tie you up with barbed wire, carve my name in your face
Pour gasoline on you, drop you at the gas station
Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyurethane
Cocoa butter cream, vaseline and drugs baby like codeine
Low self-esteem? Uh-uh, the flow is excellent
Yours is satisfactory, return them to the factory
I mean practically, the shit is wack to me
Mama bear, finally out of hibernating
Here to tell you chicks to stop tail-gating


[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)
I guess you know by now who's number one

So if you got beef, you better think again

Cause you can't win

It's the B-I-G-M-A-M-A
Often tipsy, cabin in Poughkeepsie
I've been in this shit since Biz hit the
One-two, nothing left to do
Move it in there, cathedral ceilings
Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings
P.Diddy introduced me to the business side
Spotted me a few mill and a couple of oil spills
That's how we do it, you chicks is no frills
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
Stealin' tricycles, ridin' bicycles
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
On the countdown (giggles) - don't make me laugh
Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff
They say we twins, then I'm the better half
I'm nasty! Worse than Howard Stern
This court is adjourned, and now it's your turn, bitch!


[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from

So if you got beef, you better think again

You see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends
I'm going after the big man
My g-string make his dick stand
Make it quick, then slow head by the night stand
Like lightning, I wanna nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines
Blank note to take everything
See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho
Young jazzy ho and don't be scared
If you're curious just ask me hoes
And yes dick sucking comes quite natural

While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho
See it pays to be the boss ho

Don't grow to be a dumb ho, that's a no-no

See off glass is my motto

Quick fuckin' 'bout to follow

Pull up my tights some, enticin him
You can handle the work, I'll play wit it
Til he curve and swerve nigga, stay wit it

Standing center stage, closin' the show holdin' a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hoping it's wack

No more, sharin' our pain, sharin' our maid

Put it in high gear, flip the eyewear
Nas ruled the world, but now it's my year

Hello to all my niggas and bitches
Welcome to Digglers Wild World of Girls
I'm sitting here with the Baddest Bitch (Thats Right)
So Trina tell us a little something about yourself

[Verse 1: Trina]
Hustla I'm the queen of this south shit
Tight with a cute face that's what I'm bout bitch
Sexy, specialize in fellatio
All about my pesos, never was a fake ho
Shot shore throw
Throw the cock like a flamethrower
In the mouth of a cock blower
Just a diva mack momma looking for them ends
Traded in the Lex for a G-5 Benz
Touring on the road getting stacks
20 grand karats for the show no tax
Bell-V is what I'm pourin on them hatas
Blinding with the lock no imitaders
Broke ass niggas getting on my nerves
Get sliced, diced, chopped, and served
Ask, am I off the chain? I won't lie
But I don't want your man boo fuck that guy, uh

[Interlude: Girl]
Oh, okay, all right
I see how y'all be getting down in the MIA
But Trina what I really wanna know is
How would you get with a nigga who live with a bitch?


[Verse 2: Trina]
Wait... for his bitch to live
Ms. Trina gotta trick up her sleeve
Open up the door I walk straight in the house
Put your man down and put my cock in his mouth
(Damn) I need a heavyweight like Georgy Foreman
To work my ocean like the Long Shoreman
I'm real successful, I live off interests
So get it right bitch I'm the Diamond Princess
Banking and its all for the cause
(Hey Trina would you suck a nigga dick) Bitch hell naw
And fuck what a bitch tell yall
Stay the fuck outta mine ho and go get a job, ugh

[Interlude: Girl]
Damn girl
You wild as fuck
But what I really wanna know is
How you set a motherfucker up...?

[Verse 3: Trina]
See a nigga pumpin gas, don't look
Get out your car slow drop your book
Sell em' with your name and your freak out game
And show a lil' shot of ass just to get in his brain
Tell em what he wanna hear, calm and slow
""You want this ass? Come on let's go""
Call my dawgs at the hotel, let em' know I'm coming
Bring em' upstairs and leave the car running
Get em' in the room don't be scared
Go in broke come out with bread
That's what a nigga get, playing with that cheese
Fun for a freaking, watch ya get skeeze
Out the door, real quick
Then out come my dawgs with the K's and shit
Thinking with your dick man that ain't nothing

Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals

Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement, akh
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

I'm not you

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keep that Ziploc bustin' at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless-ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah, bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow clear ya sinus 'til the snot drop out


[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it, they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Probably think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin' game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

[Verse 3: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clowns?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, ""Wow, that didn't look like my man""
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin'
Nigga have static, to his face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on 'em, pressed the .40 up on him, shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
Your coffin's your cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain ""Super Nigga,"" I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men


[Verse 4: Styles P]
Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest
No sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step
And I love getting slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope, fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor? You wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good, but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull

We in the same boat I tell them quick, ""No, I move coke"" (Uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (Uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen 'em pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (So sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)

When we met, I was talkin' that game, parkin' that thang
Since then between us, a lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies, if not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either, winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people?
Guess again, you even need to check your friends
Sayin' that I cheat, right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet with her, creep with her, even eat with her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah, I sleep with her

Believe half what you see, none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her, I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem?
Who spend like I spend? Then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it

Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs

What they gon' talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin' loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes but first let 'em know they Gucci

And even if I did twist her, I promise I didn't kiss her
Wasn't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie, no respect shown

No big up our gun men, seen? (Big up, big up)
Cuh dis ah '94 when ah RAA fi kill people and kyaan dun
Nuh waan pussy hole hold di kaanah
Watch this, lawd

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy (Uh) until I call Earl (Uh)
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
I wish Moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy""


[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend (watch me)
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem (have mercy)
Informer lone keep informer friend (do it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of 16
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kind of scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend (have mercy)
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend


[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
'94 now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend


[Post-Chorus: Diana King]
Now this is Diana King doing a Yankee thing
In a Biggie Smalls thing, do it, Ja

And everybody feel irie
And everybody just follow me, follow me, follow me

Come See Me,Ludacris,"29 ContributorsCome and See Me Lyrics[Spoken Intro]

[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a new whip I cause a scene
Rolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy
So whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me

[Verse 1: Ludacris + Big KRIT]
I'm talking Monte Carlos, Crown Vics, Cadillacs and Regals
If I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal
But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun
Knowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one
Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too
Hanging out the window front and center, servin' niggas like a late-night Wendy's drive through
Tweeters, speakers, geekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga
I got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl, it’s return of the mack, my nigga
It's the return of the 'Lac
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'ma let my soul glo
Fleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate
And all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake
Blast the bass in the face
The law's right beside me, my window tint dark
My rims are too large
As soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me
Ridin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk
Popped up twice with two hoes in the trunk
Disturb your peace with fifteens that thump
Touch my slab get sawed off with the pump


[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene
Rolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy

(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me

[Verse 2: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]
I got two floors in my trunk, club lights in my trunk
I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk
Cause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard
My wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, Lord
I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on
My seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette
007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho
I got all these alpine, that they could turn a square chick ratchet, ho
Neon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho
Young and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho
Like a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom


[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene
Rolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy
So whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me

(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me

[Verse 3: Ludacris + Big KRIT]
Okay now, pour on out that drink and watch me fire up that blunt
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk?
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
O-o-o-okay, now bow down when you see me, don't be trippin' on the thump

Red, white and blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-poppin', her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes

Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimmin' pool

Execution

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'till you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly; your traitor is your neighbor
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth; the weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth, stillborn or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones, straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung, I'm the one

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle up dudes
Who got big mouths, no power
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shallah is ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica
With tuna salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come through with rifles rockin Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption


[Hook: Pusha T]
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with lasers under Rugers
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork, the runners; footwork
The custies took work, the soldiers put work in
On any one of the motherfuckers who fuck up good work
Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work,' that's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second-hand swept across that pretty Breitling
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team

Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em

In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitches singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor

Check! Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
It’s the microphone methadone, greatest ever etched in stone
You ain’t getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga I’m your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I’m a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest, let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
'Cause, uh, bitches come (And uh) bitches go (Uh)
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door (You know)
They might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote TECs and stuff, to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend, bitch
'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend, bitch
And you know that ain't right

I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds

Yeah we know, drop the scenario
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine, uh

Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Duckin' the plain cops, pushin' endo and 'caine
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touchin' the floor
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards

Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path

So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt

[Verse 1]
Quit talkin', I'ma hang you by your tongue, yeah
Any motormouth could get hung high
We don't fuck with niggas like fungi, we don't even hear ya
Hollerin' bullshit, nigga, cut the diarrhea (Get 'em)
Pistol lie inside of the armrest (Yeah), um, yes
Lay a nigga down in his own mess (Yeah), don't mess
Player fuck around with the homeless (Yeah), charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies (Go)
Honest, you niggas is harmless
I'm calm as a don is supposed to (Be), Cosa Nostra
Don't ever approach him (Nah), don't get close to him (Uh-uh)
Shootouts ain't nothin' but rock and roll to him (Damn)
Leave your blood on the dash', call it rosewood (Ugh)
'Nother murder, 'nother page out the notebook
It ain't nothing and don't make it if you no good
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

[Chorus]
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up

Throwing up fingers, saying, ""My side rule"" (Yeah)
If a nigga disagree, that's when my side prove (Get 'em), yeah
That Maybach coupe a cockeyed fool
And I'm in it like Bennett, ho, aren't I cool?
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move (Uh-oh)
Then the attitude switch and that heat'll move
I got that Chiquita banana clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe, swallow the truth
Belch reality, how does it taste?
Powder your face, you a bitch, nigga
All pussy, stop comin' out your lips, nigga
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

[Verse 3]
Real talk, boy, chill with the talk, boy (Yeah)
That Tommy gun'll tear your neighborhood apart, boy (Blatt)
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
You start with the wrong boy, it end with a song, boy (Oh)
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone (Yeah)
Fuck the discussion, I ain't into it, boy
I just get to it, let's do it, rip through a boy (Bah)
Big Uzi, just shoot a boy (Brr)
I'm inside looking out, you just an intruder, boy (Get 'em)
You need sutures on your smoochers, boy, but

Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""

You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat

So fly I'ma take off when I leap

Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things

Ain't no competition, two Perkies in my hand
She just washed 'em back, already off a Xan'
I been rollin' all night (Ear Drummers), barely can feel my hands
G6, 'bout to take flight, get a bitch out of her pants
I'm tryna visit the sights
Treat you like this is the last time I'll see you in all of my life
Right now, I do not know who I am (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Look at my eyes, how high I am
Tweakin', I feel like I'm flyin'
Lately, been thinkin' 'bout dyin'
But right now, I'm feelin' alive again
I've been up for three days, still do not feel tired
I'm in my zone, I'm wired
I wanna take you higher

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I wanna live inside her, it's like a fire
Feelin' inspired, I wanna take you higher
I wanna take you higher, takе you higher
Like a choir, singin' just like a choir
Fuckin' on you for hours
Lеt's hop in the shower
Quickie, get sticky, I gotta change my attire
Hopin' she's not a liar
Movin' just like Michael Myers
Was already geeked, then I heard a beep, I just received me a new wire


[Chorus: Lil Yachty, Lil Yachty & Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne]
Ain't no competition, two Perkies in my hand

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm in my zone, I'm wired
I wanna take you higher
I wanna date Shania
I wanna date Zendaya
I hit the club like Tiger
Hoes takin' shots like Pfizer
Hoes passin' out like flyers
Them hoes want that Oscar Mayer
She ask a nigga to wife her
Told her I can't, she say, ""Why, sir?""
I told her that I can only be your sexual advisor
I don't play games like Kyler
We gon' get higher
If it's a blowjob, she gon' get hired
I stay ten toes down, feet to the fire
I kick them hoes out, I be like, ""Hiyah""
If she explode, then I'ma ignite her
She suck my soul out like a vampire
I 69 her, this dick a recliner
Eat the vagina like I'm a piranha
At the diner
And right now, do not know who I am
Lil' bitch, it's Young Moolah, I'm YM
I been up for three days
Balenciaga PJs
These shoes cost like 10K
They don't come out 'til 3K
Shoppin' in the UK
Listenin' to UGK
My plug contact is Kim K
I call him when I need Ye
Fuck the competition
Key in the ignition
You havin' wet dreams 'cause you sleepin' with the fishes

Never Die (feat. Lil Wayne),Nas,"1 ContributorTranslationsEnglishNas - Never Die ft. Lil Wayne (Traducción al Español) Lyrics[Letra de ""Nas - Never Die ft. Lil Wayne (Traducción al Español)""]

[Intro: Nas]
Sí, no vamos a morir nunca, yo—
No vamos a morir nunca, soy un ícono en tiempo real
¿Por qué esperé tanto para dejarlos a todos en mi mente enferma?
No vamos a morir nunca
No vamos a morir nunca, yo voy—, um
Sí, no vamos a—, uh

[Verso 1: Nas]
No vamos a morir nunca, íconos en tiempo real
¿Por qué esperé tanto para dejarlos a todos en mi mente enferma?
Creo que el odio era fuerte, así que entré en una vibra relajada
Nunca pude decir adiós, dejé llorar a mi habilidad
Dejé que mi alma sangre, dentro de un Rolls, usando rosarios
Amigo, amo el nuevo NY porquе soy el nuevo NY
Y el viеjo NY al mismo tiempo (Al mismo tiempo)
Siempre hago el último tiro cuando es hora de jugar (Hora de jugar)
Jordan, Kobe, 'Bron hablan, tomo un largo paseo
Podrías empezar a entender lo que te estoy poniendo (Poniendo)
Dejé más flows en las sesiones de Pro Tools
De lo que alguna vez pensaste con los métodos de la vieja escuela
Pero lo que estás escuchando es el presente
Durante los descansos y samples de Nueva York, NWA
Los nuevos Brand Nubians, N-A-S y Wayne
No me amenaces con pasar un buen rato, estamos para quedarnos
Nasty, no los hacen como yo
Enmascarado, todo de negro como si fuera Pooh Shiesty, la verdad también
Soy como Detroit Red con un traje zoot, tornillos sueltos
A cualquier gran desafío, le encuentro un bucle
Loopholes, por qué me tratan tan mal, Club Nouveau, diablos
Los tiempos en los que vivimos son cruciales
Este es mi flow Tom Cruise, pistola alta, son demasiado lentos
Las computadoras no son lo suficientemente rápidas para seguir el ritmo de Nasty, porque:


[Puente: Nas]
No vamos a morir nunca
Ja-ja-ja
Ah
No vamos a morir nunca, no vamos a—
No vamos a morir nunca
No vamos a morir nunca, soy un ícono en tiempo real
Soy un ícono en tiempo real, no vamos a morir nunca

[Verso 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, íconos, pisando en pitones
Hablando de esa cayena, te comeré como Sion, alcanzando su punto máximo en el horizonte
Alcanzando las estrellas como si estuviera alcanzando el pilón
Te vi en la banca, tenemos que caminar una buena línea
Necesitamos leer las pautas, en lugar de leer las líneas de tiempo
Donde a todos les gusta mentir, ningún flow como el mío
Estoy sonando a estos negros, me tengo entrenando negros como Prime
Lengua, nunca muerdo el mío, tengo dinero como Taekwon'
Para gastar todo este dinero, tendré que pasarme toda una vida
Eres pobre, ni siquiera puedes ganar tiempo
Debería darles a los negros un salvavidas
Sabes que tengo dinero en mente y yo estaré en la mente de tu esposa
La follé con la pipa, luego la pasé por el oleoducto
Pero en realidad, estamos bastante bien
Los diamantes brillan sobre mí y salpican como un poco de vino blanco
Me aman en la noche, me odian cuando brilla la luz
Disparos, yo tengo 100, y de problemas, tengo 49
Bugatti Veyron, despegué sin tiempo de vuelo
Perra mala en el lado del pasajero, a ella ni siquiera le gusta volar
Culo suave como el nailon, estos negros pequeños como un micrón
Tengo una nina Negra que se pone desagradable como una rubia blanca
Bajo crédito, crimen alto, mente abierta, rimas apretadas
Cuando escuchan mis líneas, estos raperos tienen que ponerse al día como Heinz
Weezy y mi hermano Nas, no hay nadie como el nuestro
Como en el pasado, tengo que dejar que los íconos sean íconos; hola mamás (Hola mamás)",Carter II,Lil Wayne
Used To,Drake,"195 ContributorsUsed To Lyrics[Produced by WondaGurl]

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it


[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy


[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch


[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man",Carter II,Lil Wayne
Bounce,2 Chainz,"146 ContributorsBounce Lyrics[Intro: Lil Wayne]
3 Chainz, oww

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’? Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the SWAT is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say, ""Don't ask me nothing""
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It’s gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble


[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I’m back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine, turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like, ""Hi, officer""
When he ask me why I was swerving, ""I’m high, officer""

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself

I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album


[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah

[Verse 8: 2 Chainz]
I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches


[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself

You from Harlem, you already know
You on that hustler's mission, you tryna get that paper
Wifey like it one minute, next minute, she don't, man
You know they at home watchin' Lifetime, on the internet
But you got to do you
I got it, come on (Let me tell you)

[Verse 1]
Uh, yo, my mami Toy (Toy), was my pride and joy (Joy)
She would drive the toys (Toys), plus ride the boy (Boy)
To supply the boys, I got it live from Croix
Yes, a nine in boy, wore a five in boys (Five)
Over the chick shit, I shoot five with Roy (Five)
Now I load the four-five, shoot five at Roy (Now I gotta strap up)
Ain't like my job or guys I employ
Lifestyle, I enjoy, but I'm the livest doy (Doy)
A hustler and Cam famous (Famous), you damn anus
I don't know, but I can't change it
Can't paint it (Nope), pop it, champagne it
Stop it, car, drop it, it look dull, damn, paint it (Candy)
She would throw a pout (Pout), how I'm showin' out (Out)
How I'm outgoing, but don't be goin' out
It's things to know about when you got dough and clout
Ways to move, know the route, baby girl, close your mouth (Shh)
'Cause I feed you well (Well), every sneaker, hell (Every)
You eat Louis, shit Gucci, breathe Chanel (Breathe)
Karl Lagerfeld, actin' like Gargamel
For the car, cop the cell, and the bar, stop it, hell (Stop it)
""Wrong with you?"" She said, ""What's wrong with you?""

Nigga with an attitude, meet me after math (Math)
Had a half and half (Half)
Not a drink, two chicks that flip acid fast, the half a tab
You could ask her ass, I would dash and laugh (Huh)
You after me? Huh, I'm after cash (Cash)
I'm on I-80, though, with my baby (Baby)
Whole ride hazy, tell her don't drive crazy (Crazy)

Almond drop-top, my charm is alarmin' (Alarmin')
I was alertin' her just to reinsert in her
That I would leave Earth with her, huh, I can't interpret her (Can't understand you, what are you doin'?)
She got mad, I leaned over, I'm nursin' her
Said when I do dirt with her the only time I flirt with her
Not to be VI, but this is BI
BI, me and GI be watched by the PIs (PIs)
See why we can't finish together?
I'd rather do business than pleasure and that's real (Killa)

Word to my grandma, ""He one bad mama jama, damn"" (Damn)
So I don't write for the stardom (Nope)

I've been through it, headed right for the bottom
D.C., nah, would've been a sniper in Harlem (So what?)
That's why I throw some dough to my co-D from Kos-tovo
Help me get on overflow (Shh), no one supposed to know
But she lay me up like the prime minister (Uh-huh)
Thousand grams of dope, smellin' like Heinz vinegar (Damn)
That was a lot to linger (But what?), but to the top, I bring her (What happened?)
When it came to dope (What?), I always copped in fingers (Uh)
Money missin', oh, shit, I almost chopped some fingers
Slit some wrists, that's when they said, ""Oh, shit, he's not a singer"" (Oh, he don't just rap)

And hope the chicken sandwich last us through the night, child

Back to the kitchen, that Pyrex Vision
Pot, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitching (What)
Yeah, I'm sorry, but this is how I'm living
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!


[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone, watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home, hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (Say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching 'Shaft', clocking math

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high; will I survive?
In the city where the skinny niggas die
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year, so, okay, okay, okay
Y'all can't fuck with me – no way, José, or Héctor Camacho
TEC blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker, I'm the best, I told y'all before
I showed y'all before, ay!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone, watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home, hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (Say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching 'Shaft', clocking math


[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa (Killa...)
I'm on the west side of Chicago, looking for a bust-down
Don't make me put my two arms up, touchdown! (What up, ma?)
You stay in touch now, but when I touch down
I'm like Buckshot, shorty, Duck Down
Yeah, I must clown, I'm from Harlem, Uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, ""What now?""
Birds flip a dozen, chicks, it's dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, Toya's kissing muffin
Worse than that, they go home and kiss they husband (Shit's foul)
The shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons bugging
This on my wrist is nothing
Yeah, it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhyming
You fucking with Pablo, bravo
Mario Villabona, hoe, ta'to

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]

Listening to gangsta music, ay!

Yo, I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with coco, strong as Bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum Ro-ro
Anti-homo, that's a no-no, so fuck po-po
I push the seven-fo'-oh and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I’m with a bitch or I’m dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I, buck for heads
I even buck celebs – nigga, fuck the Feds
My underground niggas, y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now, so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
That's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be


[Chorus: Big L]
Ayo, gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say Platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now is wack to us

Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say Platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now is wack to us

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
And cats still wonder can they get as hot as he been
That probably depends, let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriotts down to Quality Inns
Hit the bar, spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out, rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood, flippin' the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggas come in the game, block their shot at the rim
That ain't in you – the fuck you gon' possibly win?
I do it, ""Booty Calls"" on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip, make cream just like Reddi-Wip
Heavy with–styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit, watch how much lead he get
You tryin' to go places, chasin' oasis
About nothin', gettin low wages
Drink Hennessy with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frazier's, I'm the bodacious
Body parts are big and like Schwarzenegger's
Smokin' Garcia y Vega, tryin' to get the larger paper
If you, block the cash, we lockin' ass
I'ma put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I don't mind to burn niggas like CDs
Now, exhibit, styles I kick with it
{*cough*} Pardon me, but I'm fuckin' sick with it

Man, first I just wanna salute my soldiers
Knahmean? We just trying to stay above water

Lock into this time and lock out (always)
I mean ain't nothing promised to niggas like us
You know?

[Juelz Santana]
Just a, another day another dollar
Now look what you got
Another hater, another plotter
Shit, you know the drill
A brother pay, a brother holla
Watch 'em, they creeping
Another raid, another copper
Aw man
Another case, another lock-up
What
Another bail, know that cake better pop up
Yup
That's just day to day shit we go through
And results of the day to day shits we go through
Some niggas day to day pitch, they local, and
Some niggas day to day bricks, they coastal, and
Some niggas day to day snitch, they vocal
I don't honor them fools
Them type of dudes get they tonsils removed
I speak from the heart of the hood
From the boarded up apartments with wood
From the cracked down crack houses (yeah)
To the burnt up black houses
To fiends inside with that burnt up glass out
And puffing weed makes my actions switch
I'm at the window, with the pistol, like Malcolm
Ain't that a bitch (man)
And I'm paranoid, paranoid
But still I got to get it, got to have it, make it happen boy


[Hook]
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take
And may this song play all the way
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat

And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me

Look now
Another dead, another born
Vice versa
Another here, another gone
Pay attention
Another smile, another mourn
Another funeral, another baby shower going on
Get it, huh
That's just life in the hood
You earn scars, you earn stripes in the hood
Huh, get it
I live the life of a hustler
No sleep all night for a hustler, buster
And if your coke weak, cut it with Bo Peep sheep
I swear fiends will chase that high for four weeks
I'm still dealing with the day to day beef and
Stress, hunger, patience
The day to day basics
Yep, shit that we go through, you know
Shit
Look at the shit that we go through, you know

Niggas getting money, acting like they can't get robbed

Uh-huh, real life shit
Na'mean, true story
Feel me, matter of fact still feel me
Uh, yeah

[Verse]
Ayo, past few years shit got so ill
Kinda hard for the God to laugh through tears
I went through something with momma, no drama
Something that came and went, real life karma
My pop think his son is deserting him, its hurtin him
Guess I gotta be the man, sit down and work with him
My little boy 7, he the sequel to the thug
So I told him the money will never equal to the love
Listen I'm grown y'all
When it comes to my family it ain't never a problem, it's only a phone call
They tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new phone, new number shit
They violated Stay again
Gus totaled the Beamer and broke Kay leg again
Shhh, let us pray again
And I ain't get enough of hanging in the local bars yet
Had to let the thing off, 'cross town in the projects
All these rumors and shit, I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggas ain't stop acting like broads yet
In arm reach off a gun and a mask
Somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool 'til a muh'fucking tour bus flipped
Uh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up, then I put a court up
Now the road to the riches is taking me longer
It ain't kill yet so it making me stronger
I don't know if its the hate, frustration, or hunger
That keep a nigga going, rapping for a reason
Shit don't just don't happen, shit happens for a reason
I'm that dude, like it or love it
I do my thing in the hood, and get right with a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my 16's give you a visual
I know you thinking he ain't really selling, how he live off residuals
But right now the game is pitiful
Niggas is lonely, they need company 'cause they miserable
Yeah, uh-huh shit it still real B
That's why I want you to still feel me

Curriculum 101,Canibus,"35 ContributorsCurriculum 101 Lyrics[Intro: movie sample]
Claims are being made that for me go far beyond the available evidence and in fact in many cases are contradicted by the evidence and that bothers me

[Verse: Canibus]
Forensic psychologist Samuel Dubios
Explains, ""You'll probably never understand Germaine""
Incoherent speeches, puzzles in pieces
The sub-chemical deepness of his glandular excretions
Realms of Heaven and Hell
Glowing angelic gel spliced with bovine leukaemia cells
Demons in Hell they call to me, I scream, ""What can you offer me?""
They reply, ""Techno-Sorcery""
They tell me the meek will never inherit the world
'Cause they're weak standing on two 12 inch feet
I dream quasi-Draconian dreams when I sleep
Peyote leaves mixed with the blood of a priest
In a room where the ceiling leaks of crimson grease
Where the living eats the dead and the dead reek
Rock-bottom transforms human beings to beasts
Why the fuck you think we got canine teeth?
It's the optical stimuli of watching men cry
I hope I've got time to repent before I die
Bury me at the beach if the sea is out of reach
'Cause when I speak, what's fluid becomes concrete
Like a falcon up in the sky, 10,000 feet
Looking down at you bitches looking at me
Phase shifting to 45°
I'm too crooked to see, I memorize the books that I read
Sucking from the breast of knowledge – constantly weaning
Unbeseemingly a genius without meaning
Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling
Handcuffed underwater without breathing
Near death on a fatal quest for air
But why should anyone care? He put himself there
His career was based on facing his fears
To take destiny from the hand of the man upstairs
He didn't mind the cold stares he got from his peers
They couldn't tell him where he was going or how to get there
It's better to be prepared and fail
Than to be scared and unsure of yourself and still get killed
Don't rhyme like I used to but I still got skills
More than a couple confirmed kills under the belt
Hunting MCs like hunting elk
Camouflaged in the dense brush for stealth, determined as Hell
I don't do this for anybody except myself
Stuff a motherfucker like a trophy on my shelf
Fuck the promo, nigga I do this for dolo
Flow from the first hour to 24:00
Round the clock, long as I got a cup of cocoa
But I'll be a no-show if my girl cries, ""Don't go!""
And she give me blow more than two times in a row
I'd rather chill with her than kill you with a rhyme that I wrote
Count how many mics I smoke minus the G.O.A.T
Bus is dope, my battling average higher than most
When I'm on the mic I release fire from throat
If you disagree please do it quietly folks
Anybody better than Bis must be a hoax
Black man? No! What about the Great White Hope?
What? Man you must be sniffing great white coke
Don't you know that's like Gary Coleman fighting the Hulk?
Still not even quite that close
A great white biting your rubber dingy boat 50 miles out from the coast
What the fuck is the Mathers with you?
I'll beat you black and blue then I get a tat of you too
Better yet I'll put a tattoo of me on you
A ten by ten 'C' logo – neon blue
The most theatrical MC battle of all time
I rip jackers like you, you know my call sign
Killer cobras that hover over Jehovah
In motorized auto-giros with sycamore rotors
Hydrogen-peroxide, gaseous vapors
Technically these words shouldn't even rhyme off paper
In theory, for every soul that can hear me, I'ma blaze them
In practical practice my style's even greater
Can't you see what I'm spitting? Can't you hear the difference?
Compared to me you're energetically inefficient
You need ten times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes
You've got to rewind every one of my lines
Do you know how to paraphrase?
Do you even understand what the narrator is tryna say?
The climax explodes, nobody can foreshadow my flow
Figuratively the language is too dope
Academic journals print my lyrical quotes
They show parallelism in all the albums I wrote
On any track I come off strong automatically
Whether I write in an active or passive capacity
Poetry that I spit is synonymous to a glyph
Written on tablets of clay mortar mix
Superb, truly superb! Analyze the words
It's like observing the birds fly above the Earth
The Eye of Horus, the miniature torii within the giant torus
With singularity on the chorus, I still sound enormous
Borderline insanity tryna break through humanity's border
With a new curriculum every quarter
I'm the porter of the portal of the Secret Mic Club Order
Baptize you with Jamaican white rum and water
If you've got a hundred bars then I know you're a warrior
I'll be the one who awards you and pins the medal on you
Dedicate a song to you because now you're honorable
You want a record deal?
Explain the lyrical Grand Unified Field so I can test your skill
Do it in front of the class, chart diagram it
And write it in Latin not Spanish goddamnit
Step back so I can look at it
(No puede entender las palabras que dio senior Williams?)
Huh? What the fuck is that wack shit?
You're clumsy and dumb like a hand with five thumbs

This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclub.net where you can read this
Run a plot on the map in hyperspatia
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
Color is vibration, vibration is sound
Sound resonates through the mouth, check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South, South East, West, South West, East
North, North East, North West
And the black and white images fade to grey sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
The Best of Bis orbitally rearranged
Monoatomic elements with adept intelligence
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
Compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria
Before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I could've learned more
About the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidean in form
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold, moulded in Assyria
With processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
And they burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
Said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but I'll think about going
The process was slow and the dough was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I ain't never travelled that far from home
But I heard about the beauty of Cydonian snow
Neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass, I'll be crazy to pass
I like Algerian Jazz
The blue twilight band that plays, tunes from a laser black sax
It sounds so laid back, it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing K-Pax
Oh how I miss my nautilus
I was told pharyngoamygdalitis did not exist
You have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neo-gothic antibiotics
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
Deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translate the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now but death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Used the aphrodisiac to get a female
Called Ginger, tie her up and drink her ginger ale
Grand Marnier for me, scotch on the rocks for you
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's
In the studio with James Lipton
Reminiscing about the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turned into applause
My jaw's stronger than the Caninde Macaw's
Can't even count the bars I've expended so far
Don't want to rap no more, it's been so long
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
I'm out in the bush and the sticks humping a 100 clicks
Dr Scholls gave me a good fit
Me and him went to school together back in '86
When I was really ill
Putting Planck energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
You wanna laugh now and cast your belligerent doubt
Show you what poetry's really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Followed by skin rash, itching, diarrhoea, nausea and dry mouth
You want a time out? You better spit a rhyme out
Before the community of real MCs die out
College students say to me, ""You ain't smart!""
Record label A&Rs say, ""This ain't art!""
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
Listen to my chest beat, tell me this ain't heart
You got to be as obsequious as the Disciples of Jesus

Rap career is over, better off actin'
What trouble I see in managin' WC and Wack 10?
You backed into a 4-Corner Hustla
Lyin' on your dick, said you was fuckin' her
Use higher learning, don't take my words outta 'text
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX
It'll take the nation of millions to hold me back
From givin' you mouth shots, or hit with the pipe that Ralph got
Chris Tucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good
I wasn't salty she was with the Boyz N the Hood


[Chorus]
I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind
The bitch in you, lookin' me in my eyes lyin'
I see the bitch in you, to be hard, you tryin'
The bitch in you, it's comin' out (BITCH!)

[Verse 2]
The ump of this rap shit — Cube I'm callin' out
I break in and smack niggas that's in the Slaughterhouse
This ain't no East Coast, West Coast, none of the above
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali (And what?), niggas gave me love
There's a thin line between the fake and the real
Grafted-ass nigga, I see through your ""Glass Shield""
Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo
I'm a have to wreck a HO'Shea
I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper
(So what?) So I had to slap her, uh!
And violate you (You), a Muslim drinkin' brew (Brew)
Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22
I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit in ATL
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat
A year ago, you wasn't talkin' shit about the West
Guess you knew yo' shit was done, plus the one got you cable
Hoo-bangin'? You ain't bangin' shit but the table
And the Circle MAAD (Uhhh)
Ain't got no choice but to fight (Come on)
Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic
Any time you come out, Joe, I'ma talk about you
Until you let that bitch in you walk up out you
Any last words before I hit the switch?
From the immortal words of one: ""A bitch iz a...""


[Chorus]
I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind
The bitch in you, lookin' me in my eyes lyin'
I see the bitch in you, to be hard you tryin'
The bitch in you, for sho', it's comin' out (BITCH!)

The Bridge Is Over,Boogie Down Productions,"57 ContributorsThe Bridge Is Over Lyrics[Intro]
I say

[Chorus: KRS-One]
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, hey, hey
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye
The bridge is over, the bridge is over

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
You see me coming in di dance with the spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well, you must see me
You can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl, dem a rhyming like they gay
Picking up the mic, man, dem don't know what to say
Saying hip-hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, man, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan
Tell them again, me come to tell them again
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan
Tell them again, me come to tell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it and Queens keeps on faking it

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Di-di, di-da, di-di-di, di-da, di-day, ayy
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play? 'Cause
Here's an example of KRS-One (Buck)
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP, but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock, 'cause
We don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions come in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out, he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shanté is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said, ""I tell you now, you ain't nothing""
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now, man, I me say easy now, man
To KRS-One, you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
The name of this routine is called ""Live At Union Square""
Square, square, square, ooh
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't you know that he's out of touch?
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking 'bout your wack Puma sneaker
'Cause Bronx created hip-hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking 'bout the Juice Crew funny
But you're still telling lies to me",Dr. C. Ph.D,Canibus
Beasts From The East,Lost Boyz,"72 ContributorsBeasts From The East Lyrics[Pre-Intro: Mr. Cheeks]
""The forecast — showers heavy at times
With occasional thunderstorms today, and a high of 89 degrees""
The cops says to me, ""Yo, kid...""
""Partial clearing and a low of 74""
Damn! Kghhh!

[Intro: Mr. Cheeks]
Basically, kid
Word, Ren zone, wanna hit?
Queens!
This microphone, I got Canibus
You know how many member L.B. fam get motherfuckin' biz
Along on this track, we got the Funk Doctor Spock
Canibus and A+ from park-sized blocks
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Bink! Dawg locks it down

[Verse 1: Mr. Cheeks]
Yo, we come through like bulls, see, ’cause niggas takin' two pulls and pass
Nigga, watch your back once you talk out your ass
I pack a .380 in my stash for protection
Family to raise, the world is actin' crazed
I never thought I'd make it, it was hectic when I scrambled
On point like a knife, I'm takin' life as a gamble
Livin' in the Rotten Apple, ayo, where every core is rotten
All my niggas, rest in peace, ya see, you're gone but not forgotten
Now my main wifey, deaded shady chicks
Official Lost Boy since the year of '86
And fuck these crooked niggas, I could kill 'em with the passion
At times, I feel like blastin' in Jamaica, Queens fashion
You think you can fuck around, but kid, you just thinkin'
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinkin'
Without blinkin', man, I'll tear your crew like pages
I’ll rip you from the backyards, parks and on stages


[Verse 2: A+]
A+ the lyrically superb one
Spittin' rhymes off the top of the tongue to burn your ear drum
Rockin' shit, make the opposite team call a time-out
Knockin' niggas three times my size out
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around, they ask for me
I buckle up and catch wreck like a crash dummy
For the fast money, I get up in that ass, money
The fact you tryna test me kinda bugs me
I leave crews fed up, like handicapped niggas tryna get up
MCs get wet up with lyrical gun pellets
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock
I speak out my voice box and peak out at a hundred watts
Who wanna cipher? I get dumb!
Word to my mother, the Father, the Holy Ghost and Rev Run
When it's all said and done, I end the service
Concoctin' the type of verses average MCs worship

[Interlude: Redman, Canibus]
Fuck with the lyrical skills, you get killed
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Big Dog! Turn the track off!
Yo, fake MCs, step to the rear!
Fuck how you feel
Yo, real MCs bring this shit Up North!
Fuck with the lyrical skills, you get...


[Verse 3: Redman]
My style is Milk of Magnesia, clutch the five speed and bust
The more the merrier, secure the area
My La Familia is ultimate superior
We don't jack cars, we jack for aircraft carriers
I bounce like trampolines when I be blowin' the fiends to pieces
Hem 'em like sewing machines and Jesus
When the shadows of the barrel pointin' out my boy Camaro
I get punished like Pharaoh for splittin'
You're better off singin' Christmas carols for Christmas
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment
The president of chicken head conventions
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin'
I got a headache from the stress, success, not wearin' a vest
5-11 for bein' dirty, court's at 9:30
Yo, Mr. Cheeks! I made this bitch call police
She tried swallowin' the nine piece, but got a warranty on false teeth
I return like Makaveli on 18-inch Pirelli's
Assault and battery like my palms is Eveready
Sharp as machetes
Matter of fact, I slap for cognac to make the beef heavy

[Verse 4: Canibus]
The Canibus brings the sickest drama, fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor
I smack bitches for tryna suck dick through a condom
Playin' with the mic is somethin' I won't do
My only concern when I approach you is to roast you
I smoke you and whoever you standin' close to
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you
Defeatin' niggas like Seagal Steven
Puttin' MCs in positions to prevent 'em from breathin'
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers
What's the matter with y'all? I splatter y'all
Against the motherfuckin' wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
None of y'all got the balls big enough to battle
I'll go ""On and On"" like Erykah Badu
A hundred times nicer than the best is
Twice as arrogant as KRS is, who wanna test this?
Fuck y'all! You don't impress me and no one can test me
An MC so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me
All that shit you poppin' will stop when I put you in a headlock
And apply pressure 'til I crush your motherfuckin' noggin!
I grab mics and push niggas to the left
So fast, their hearts end up on the right sides of their chests
My hypothesis is that nobody can see this lyrical genius
I got it sewn like a seamstress
But if you wanna battle, I'm down
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now!
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard
I'm the illest from Queens to the New Jerusalem Bridicks
Anyone who ain't feelin' my shidit can suck my didick
You need to quit it if you ain't spittin'
More than 50 bars per minute 'cause you ain't in lyrical fitness
Kickin' borin' raps with metaphors that's wack
All of y'all motherfuckers need NordicTrack
To get your weight up, fuckin' with Canibus you get ate up
Beat down and sprayed up just for bringin' my name up
Been rockin' longer than niggas twice my age
Back in the days, before Bob Marley was rockin' a fade
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves
Before Neanderthals was drawin' on walls in caves
I existed in the Garden of Eden, gettin' lifted
Stickin' dick to Eve before she was Adam's mistress
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness
The Canibus is spittin' 'til he's spitless
50 bars of total sickness, you won't forget this
I'm puttin' every wack MC alive on my shit list!
Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted
Took you a minute to exhibit that I'm sick with it
Now, you tell me who you think is damagin' shit
Goin' once, goin' twice — sold to that nigga named Canibus!
Me and Mr. Cheeks, A+ and Funk Doctor
Hoppin' out the Huey helicopter to suey chop ya!

Ay carumba
I'm gonna Bankhead bounce
No doubt
Watch your mouth

Ayo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack that sound like Heaven
Seven, six, five, four to three, two, one
Mo'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickenin', best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble, bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo' meat lump, respect Wu


[Verse 2: Redman & Method Man]
Yo, ayo, I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (Explode)
When you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit, I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in come with fog halogen
Terrorize your city from the spliff committee
Kick ass 'til both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy
When I approach, rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep cummin' 'til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you, ""Fuck you"", my attitude is anaemic
[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I'll start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?""
I could go on for more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take 'em on in all shapes, sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it


[Verse 4: DMX]
Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
Run it now, however it's gon' go, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at? Do you value your life as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock 'cause it's better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick, you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it, baby
You's a big nigga, ski mask for it, baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat

[Chorus 2: Redman & Method Man]
Ayo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack, shine like Heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Come on, Mr. Smith, come get some (Some, some, some)
[Verse 5: LL Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (Ha, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension (Uh-huh)
Your little ass should be somewhere crying on detention
Watch your mouth, better yet, hold your tongue (Uh)
I'ma do this shit for free this time, this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (LL Cool J is hard)
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike (Uh-huh)
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight (Uh)
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas?
For rappers in my circle, I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees (Uh)
In the history of rap, they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (Word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side, it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad, nigga, you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name (LL)
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth, don't ever step out of line

It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada, **** Poppa
You gotta call me Francis M.H.

Was told in shootouts, stay low and keep firin'
Keep extra clips for extra ****

The most shady (Tell 'em) Frankie, baby
Ain't no tellin' where I may be
May see me in D.C. 
At Howard Homecoming with my man Capone, dumbin'
***** somеthin', you should know my steelo
Went from ten Gs for blow to thirty Gs a show
To orgies with ****** I nеver seen before, so
Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis 'fore I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal ****, I make it hot like a kettle get

On ya mark, get set when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked for death (Uh)
Should I start your breath, or should I let ya die?
In fear, you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically I'm worshiped, don't front, the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird ****, you herbs get
Stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin', I punish 'em (Uh-huh)
I'm done with them (Uh-huh), son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got *** in them, 'cause they nothin' but *****
Tryna blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke ***** and rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, layin' with your *****
I know you prayin' you was rich, ****** *****, when I see ya, I'ma

Look into the deadest tree, tell me baby what you see
Don't you hear the branches cry, asking for the reasons why
Did they hang so many men from the branches off of them
Why did humans make them play, with them in their evil way
Look into the moon’s beam, can you fathom what it's seen?
Bodies dragging from a truck, driven by a bigot fuck
Why you think the heavens cry, acid rain and blizzard sky
Ain't no covering the tracks, and that's why I'm here, and oh yes

My axe is my buddy, he'll thump into your head
Me and my axe will make your white hoodies red
My axe is my buddy, you let that Dixie wave

Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life

We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari

And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up""

Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain

I made Jesus Walks, so I'm never going to hell

Jump off in that lane, you gon' get put on a poster

I turn ten bricks into twelve, them birds had a growth spurt
We gon' do some shoppin' later, I'ma need some throat first

Iced out all my ghetto hoes who turned into influencers

Best shit out her closet, it's hot as hell, she got on Yeezy UGGS
I got moes with me, bump out the feds, mean I got foes with me
You got goofies with you, before I do that, I keep some hoes with me
Askin' for my gun when I'm in Cali', nigga, this your city
Why you DM'in' my bitch actin' like we fucked? These hoes below-silly
Street niggas want ramen, I don't like calamari
Took her out that cheap shit, took her to Bvlgari
Never tell her, ""Sorry,"" this car a Ferrari
Off set with this Cuban link, you think she was Cardi (Go)

Brody, tell me who them hoes is, man, they all fine
Hunnid' hooligans, and we with the foolishness
How I'm anti-Semitic? I just fucked a Jewish bitch
I just fucked Scooter's bitch and we ran her like Olympics
Got pregnant in the threesome, so whose baby is it?
Whose baby is it?

Stick on me even though I got security
Even though she got a man, she know he ain't as pure as me, seriously
Soon as I get back, tradin' in my Urus for the Puro' keys
Couple grey hairs up in my beard, that's showin' my maturity, yeah

She Russian, I beat up the pussy for Ukraine
Bought her a bag and I filled it with loose change
Just saw my ex and she told me that, ""You changed,"" yeah, yeah, yeah
Dolla'd done rather be fuckin' it up
Still screamin', ""Free TC, Melly, and Thug""

And how it connect to the diamonds we own

I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' 'bout Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike

Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)

I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn

As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh, yeah
He won't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead, we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time (Ha)

So they ask me
""Young boy
What you gon' do the second time around?
How you gon' come back?""
I tried told 'em
""I come back like 32
I jump back like 33""
Ugh, hit me

This is Tha Carter II, people
Hey

[Verse]
They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like, ""Keep your dough,"" he got your ho
And the sun shines on the king and sets on the prince
I met the Birdman and I been shining ever since, like that",Fireman,Lil Wayne

Bring the crowd in, I'm loud in living color
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby, got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't askin' them for nothing
If you sell a million records, we could battle for your money
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes, I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in
God, I hope they snappin' at the end of my rod
I hope I'm fishin' in the right pond
And I hope you catchin' on to every line, who am I?

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside


[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne & Eminem Eminem]
So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Haha, yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

Like what the hell am I doin' right?

Take me away

Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain

From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? (My life)
‘Cause that's Jesus' people
And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel, yeah
Like Roc-A-Fella needed Sigel, like I needed my father
But he needed a needle (My life)

And why every hood nigga feed off evil?

So approach my Phantom doors with caution

And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My life)
Damn, I know his mama proud, and since you helped me sell my dream
We can share my mama now
And like M.J.B., no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

Hustlin's in my blood my father's name is Britain
His history consisted of robbery killin' and pimpin
Filthy rich and the biggest killer that you ever seen
Once I'm older I'm takin' over ima be king
I was locked up in jail when he got the new land
Opened his cells I guess that's how the story began
First mission was to clear it out and claim it as mine
Indigenous people were peaceful it took no time
Great grandmother Africa was blind and disabled
Sons was traitors we played divide and conquer invaded
Sold her children into slavery and profited quick
Started makin' side deals and that's how I got rich
Daddy Britain found out and tried to put me in check
He don't understand I'm a man and I deserve some respect
Tried to bring it to me but I play for keeps and I won
Still my daddy but you ain't the only man with a gun
More money More problems little brother is wild
They call 'em The South he's country with a big ass mouth
Tried to show 'em new business but he don't wanna change
I love 'em but I knew eventually I'd blow out his brains
I'm America!

Me and my daddy still cool and my uncles is with us
France Russia and Italy and we all killas
But it's this nigga named Germany that's out of control
Rollin with Japan and Turkey and them niggas is bold
Started fuckin' with my uncles and we all went to war
Uncle France damn near died at the tip of his sword
When the smoke cleared we won let 'em retreat
Shoulda' killed 'em cause they knew they had us close to defeat
Kicked it off again 20 years later it was on
This time my uncle Italy traded and he was gone
I was neutral when Japan hit me guess that he knew
I ain't gone' let my family fight without me jumpin' in too
Woulda' lost if I didn't hit Germany's weapon supply
Kamikaze Japanese was always ready to die
Dropped atomic bomb let them niggas know that it's real
Speak soft with a big stick do what I say or be killed
I'm America!

I'm racin' with my uncle Russia we the ones with the guns
He supported the North so I rolled with South Vietnam
Thought it would be easy but almost 60 thousand died
They was harder than Korea so we ran for our lives
It's a family called the Middle East and they got bread
Sellin' oil they don't cut me in then off with their head
I got a nephew named Israel that's right in the middle
Pay his allowance as long as he can dance to my fiddle
I had a patna' named Iraq gave 'em weapons and money
Nigga started getting' power and he start actin' funny
Saudi Arabia's cool gotta son Bin Laden
I was trainin' his soldiers to go against the Russians and stop 'em
Then he tried to say I need to take my soldiers and cut
Gave 'em the finger that's when he flipped and blew my shit up
I took it to 'em, and then I took it back to Iraq and if you ain't my blood
Brother you gonna be flat on yo' back
The sons of Africa just invented this shit called rap
Tellin' my secrets that's why I'm puttin' their heads on flat
Built an empire quick and it might not last
But I bet I go down in history as the one that smashed

Tryna' see me when I'm speedin', you get burnt like Derek Jeter
And my Nina, she's a diva, purty like Lupita
Peter Piper, pick a pussy, make her peck my millimeter
Chilly on the chain but the seats is heated
Shawty wanna race like I been believin', spent 3 G's on the sneakers
Like three stripes and a slash, I'm undefeated
Rick Owens, I'm tip-toein', push button, Kim Jong
Rode through lookin' so cool in a old school like Vince Vaughn
Vroom, vroom, nitro, hit the turbo
Pour that Ace of Spades up, we don't want no Merlot
Cop the coupe, drop the roof, hop out the top like I'm a turtle (ooh)
Then she turn around and throw it in reverse though

Go, oh, oh, don't get hurt (Watch out)

Don't get hurt, turn around and throw it in reverse

Yeah, bend that ass over, throw it backwards
Moonwalkin to the pussy like I'm Michael Jackson (Oh)
Make a film with your bitch, turn into an actor (Ah)
Shimmy ya and then she ate a pill after
I get clothes from Vaccarello, I get Céline from Slimane
I get packages from Paris, drop that Fed-Ex, sign my name
I get runway off the runway to the runway on the plane
Told you we are not the same, see that Spyder switchin' lanes?
Give it some gas, look at the dash, what is he doin'? He goin' fast
Look at the whip, look at him smash
Look at him skrrt, look at the cash
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a man that's gone insane
He's onstage in a straitjacket, this is not a game
Yeah, lit like a candle, I been too much to handle
This velvet jacket's fragile, 'Kay, be careful when you handle, please
(Why did you touch me?) Yeah, your hands look kind of dusty
Please be careful how you touch me, in Paris, out the country, ayy

I'm on a paper chase until my toes bleed
Then I get on these beats and let my soul bleed

Look like I got on a championship ring
Cause I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder

Okay start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models, ""shut up bitch, swallow!""
If you can't swallow, shut up bitch gargle
Straight up out that water with my Marc Jacobs goggles
Fresher than a mother fucker, yep I'm a mother fucker
No I won't take your girl, but I'll sure take her tongue from her
Can't you tell I'm in love woman, like no other woman
Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman

I ain't got a lot of Nikes but I got a lot of checks
Got my own shoe brand, new on the set
Went from sittin' in a cell to sittin' on a jet
From shittin' in a cell to shittin' on a jet
I lost too many friends, but I won too many bets
I made too much money, but I ain't make enough yet
So I scratched and, yes, Jr. is the best
So many niggas from my hood on they back
So many niggas from your hood on they back
That's why we so paid and it be like that

Lovely wife, and life; baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars; success, of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

And I'm a star
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a durrn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on, but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant cobra
I'm so not sober, I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
""Bling Bling,"" I know, and did you know?
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze

But in Hollywood it's ""Litt-le Wayne,"" don't make me none

Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three-fourth of it all (Man, for what?)
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get, get, get, get, get on your knees
'Cause ""wealth"" is the word (Yep)
""Rich"" is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dré to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make a--a difference?
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel, all-new 'Kast, just ain't the same
Gang of nerds on the internet slandering your name
Behind that screen name, they're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts, won't show up face-to-face
Straight bitch-made – like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis, like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot?
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen?
(Nigga, please)
But even she can walk, we'll miss her, we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes, must be something bigger waiting

[Chorus: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife, and life; baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars; success, of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce


[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I do–love you, but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare, share, and take you there
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you, but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all the catfights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy, straight cut-out and left me

[Outro: André 3000 & Snoop Dogg]
(Starts off like a small town marriage)
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
(Lovely wife, and life; baby carriage)
Look at Blues, Rock, Jazz, Rap...
(Now all the stars have cars; success, of course)
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else, too
(But it ends in Hollywood divorce)
By the time it reach Hollywood, it's over
(Hollywood divorce)
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb, that's a cold thang",On My Own,Lil Wayne

Haha, listen close, I got duct tape and rope
I leave you missing like the fucking O'Bannons
One hand on my money, one hand on my buddy
That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming
Don't make that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick, I don't spit, I vomit, got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, ""Shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him, 'Catch up,' like mayonnaise,"" um...
I'm the sickest nigga doing it, bet that, baby
These other niggas dope, I'm wet crack, baby, yes!
Get back, get back, boy, this a setback
Clumsy-ass niggas slip and fall into a deathtrap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet 'em up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper, I stack books, ha
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga, Fee
See, every motherfucker at the door don't get a key
You're outside looking in, so tell me what you see
It's about money, it's bigger than me
I tell my homies, ""Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me,"" yeah

The whole motherfucking game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up (Hold up)

It's a issue in which you're best to handle your business, bruh
'Cause ain't no politicking with killers coming to get you, bruh

In the dark, shoot sparks like rims with no tires
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by you

Just know I got cake (Cake), and I'm not fake (Fake)

Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy

Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop 6-4, three-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock four-fifth, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off with it
Say you need bricks, I said, ""I'll get it""

Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you

And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour

The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)

Regulate,Warren G,"167 ContributorsRegulate LyricsA storybook rap, marking the meeting point of old, early rap traditions with the “gangsta”-image being formulated at the time.

In a sense, the entire song is an allegory: Nate Dogg must overcome the burden… Read More [Intro]
Regulators
We regulate any stealin' of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean
Earn your keep
Regulators, mount up

[Verse 1: Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission, tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Verse 3: Warren G]
So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said, ""I'm stuck""


[Verse 4: Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard, they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckers all in his mix

[Verse 5: Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said, ""Damn, what's next?""

[Verse 6: Nate Dogg]
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Verse 7: Warren G]
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings, I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

[Verse 8: Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate


[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 9: Nate Dogg]
I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

[Verse 10: Warren G]
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up, back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

[Verse 11: Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot, in need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell, I said, ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice, would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 12: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare you
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm


[Verse 12: Nate Dogg]
If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day
And if your ass is a buster, 213 will regulate",Juicy,The Notorious B.I.G.

So, what's up, man?
Coolin', man
Chillin', chillin'?
Yo, you know I had to call, you know why, right?
Why?
Because, yo, I never, ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?
Yeah
You know what I wanna hear, right?
What you wanna hear?
I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint

Watch your step, kid (First to set it off)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (The Inspectah Deck)

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic' like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier
The hellraiser, raisin' Hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So, uh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the **** that I'm kickin'
The lone ranger
Code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art
To rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin', ""Goodbye,"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck
Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel
I make more noise than heavy metal


[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, yo, flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh'

[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short, Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left
Uh, and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like fame, my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over like they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a, ""Soo?""
'Nough respect due to the 1-6-ooh
I mean, ""Oh""
Yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson
Or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical bud make me—


[Bridge: U-God]
Ooh
What? Grab my nut, get screwed
Ow
Here comes my Shaolin style
True
B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the, ""Soo""

Watch your step, kid (Protect your neck)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Yo, you best protect your neck)

[Verse 4: Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first, man, you're **** with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a **** nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat, rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down, now **** is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin', Ason Unique
Rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your **** ass


[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with **** in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is
You're **** with pros
And there it goes

[Verse 6: RZA]
Yo, chill with the feedback, Black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the **** your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buckest
Style, the ruckus
Ten-times-ten, men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your **** chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
He'll be comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My Clan increase like Black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare
Ge-Gecka-Genius, take us the **** out of here

[Verse 7: GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these cold killer labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now, that thought is just as bright as a twenty-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy, they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

[Interlude]
Huh, huh
Huh
Huh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

Da Mystery of Chessboxin',Wu-Tang Clan,"257 ContributorsDa Mystery of Chessboxin’ Lyrics[Intro]
A game of chess is like a swordfight
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible
[Verse 1: U-God]
Raw, I'ma give it to ya with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with 'nough niggas and 'nough guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an eighteen-wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan, and yo, the Land Cruiser's out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TECs, nickel-plated MACs, black Acs
Drug-dealin' styles with phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I gots to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now who kill niggas' father

[Chorus: Method Man]

Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shit, boom
Just warmin' up a little bit, ah-eh-em
Rappin'-in' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stackin'-in', hands clappin'-in'
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
Dun-dun-dun, enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff, huff, puff
I'm gonna catch your bluff, tuff, rough
Kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, m-m-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Pretendin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot RZA
Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


[Chorus: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Speakin' of the Devil, psych
No, it's the God, get your shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again, and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad rough task
When I struck, I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your eight-plus-one, start flippin' and trippin'
Niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son

[Verse 6: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist, hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?

And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure

My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that bind-in
X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily-armed military is necessary
It's a gamble, MCs bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs

Look out for these fatal flyin' spikes, so massive

Now bees are stingin', yo, that nigga's em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor

Fleein' the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ — the getaway driver
Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize with vocal vibes
On tracks, stabbed up with razor-sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it hard to define it
When narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin' tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock to sound proof the beatbox
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical

Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop

He looks determined without being ruthless
Something heroic in his manner
There's a courage about him, doesn't look like a killer
Comes across so calm
Acts like he has a dream
Full of passion

Well, you know why
I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway

It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

Thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass-heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hours, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, word life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it

But hold up, Moët be tasting like throw-up

You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with MAC-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son?
Do you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I'll probably wax tracks, smack rap niggas, you, facts
Niggas' lyrics are wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missiles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimum wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac'
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French, but let me speak Italian
Black stallions wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan

Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like fuck, waving they arms to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlúas on rocks
On the crack spots, rubber band wrap all my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the feds
Word up, cousin, nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out

Bring The Pain,Method Man,"91 ContributorsBring the Pain Lyrics[Intro: Method Man]
Basically
Can't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze


[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real, yeah, uh

[Interlude: Booster & Method Man]
When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
When I will be di number one (Tical)
And now yuh listen to di Gorgon (Gorgon)
And a Gorgon sound a Rein
An' any jump and come tes' mi (Test me)
Mi a-go lick out dem brain (it’s like that)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll


[Interlude: Method Man]
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (Motherfucker, I'll fuckin')
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

[Outro: Method Man]
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off and feed you nothin' but sleepin' pills
Get yours, motherfucker

Liquid Swords,GZA/Genius,"148 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiLiquid Swords Lyrics[Skit: Gibran Evans]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of 131 lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
(*Woman screaming*)
That was the night everything changed

[Intro: RZA]
See, sometimes
You gotta flash 'em back
See, niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin', we gonna take y'all back to the source
Through knowledge, yo
[Chorus: GZA & RZA]
When the MCs came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now gone off the mental plane, to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut


[Verse 1: GZA]
Fake niggas get flipped in mic fights
I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene
Like a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
But it was your op. to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my ""Clan in da Front"" want it

[Chorus: GZA & RZA]
Now, when the MC's came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now born with the mental plane to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, the RZA flip the track with the what to cut


[Verse 2: GZA & RZA]
I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords, they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
'Cause niggas' styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two-to-four
'Round the clock get that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be stickin' with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells (When the MC's)
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep, it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

[Chorus: GZA & RZA]
When the MC's came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane

Hip Hop,Mos Def,"73 ContributorsHip Hop LyricsThe second track of Mos Def’s classic album Black on Both Sides.[Intro]
You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on! Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, huh!

[Verse 1]
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
Ahaha, from the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full-blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)
While you still tryna find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's English
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)


[Scratching]
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

[Verse 2]
Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you",Brooklyn Zoo,Ol' Dirty Bastard

And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up (The ice cream man is coming)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, honey dip, summertime fine, Jheri dripping
Seen you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're cliquing
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a freshwater scrod, or may I not be God?
Attitude is very rude, boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love, hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right, true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me, hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
Goddamn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered, put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo, pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week

After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black?

So when I step in the square, dear
You better have cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui, yeah

Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like thunder
Politic to your deficit step, give me your number

Catch my eyes like pies, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time
Ice cream, you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh, baby, I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind-state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me?
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby, shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you wanna get dug like the pockets

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
'Cause, uh, bitches come (And uh) bitches go (Uh)
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door (You know)
They might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote TECs and stuff, to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?

'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend, bitch

Yeah we know, drop the scenario
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine, uh

Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

Life
I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know
[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smokin' weed in the street without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruisin' blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Troopin' outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin' fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin' dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""


[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Nas]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon, Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', clique rollin'
Trickin' six-digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa, Africa


[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Nas]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the Gat with the cocked hammer
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it
Sky's the limit, I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!

You know what I mean?

Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your Cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler!
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em, tie 'em with tape
No escape, the Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats politickin' daily wit' diplomats
See, me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on a ki of heroin

Yo! The smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit! My Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks

I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that ""Somebody gotta die"" shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so Hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar


[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon, bundle of 62
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a phat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera; be The Firm, baby!
From BK to the 'Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke, nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla, we gotta flee to Panama
But wait — it's half-and-half, ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16, double it, times 3
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Divide the profit by 4, subtract it by 8, we back to 16
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak plus a 500, cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3, we got three quarters of another ki

Thug Passion,2Pac,"65 ContributorsThug Passion Lyrics[Intro: 2Pac]
Alright, new drink: one part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug's passion, baby, y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me, pour a glass and drink with a nigga
You know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols... alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby

[Verse 1: Kastro]
Man, I could, pull like they dick would, be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier that I'll roll up a nigga like it's heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents, they got these derelicts
I thought was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinkin'
Drinkin' over a felony and hell of me and how it will be in hella shit
People tellin' me to cool out, but they ain't feelin' me
A motherfuckin' fool 'bout my fuckin' cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine, thuggin'
Huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while passin' through times
And all these backstabbers be watchin', just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with rain twinklin', diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me 'til I'm old and wrinklin'
These adversaries, they gon' have to be worryin'
'Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion


[Chorus: Jewell]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Now what if me turn this Hennessy into a robbery?
The prophecy probably suddenly switch how it supposed to be
And dirty money can't be evil 'cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there's only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
With a thug passion

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Puttin' down, mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin', I'm askin' what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to?
That's what money and fame do, see, they ain't true
Travelin' this road, my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion
Left me to fuckin' greatest, load up and take shit


[Break: Yaki Kadafi]
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

[Verse 4: Storm & Jewell]
Creep with me, through that immortal flow (That's right)
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row (Yeah)
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a thug to get you flowin' and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

[Chorus: Jewell]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
They say money don't make the man, but damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it, but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me 'bout to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me
She smiles; a nigga's full of passion, satisfaction is everlastin'
""How does it feel?"" What I'm askin' while I'm rubbin' on that ass
""Why you laughin'?"" See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious, baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical, my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby, I'm born to ball, thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion


[Chorus: Jewell & DJ Quik]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat

What's your phone number?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, I could make miracles to tempos
This instrumental's writin' for the nymphos: that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you wanna fuck me?
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on – still down?
Met you standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

[Chorus: 2Pac & Danny Boy Steward]
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?


[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Oh, shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number? Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these ordinary words that I say
If you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find
It's time, let the Outlawz play
What's ya phone number?

[Chorus: 2Pac & Danny Boy Steward]
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
(What's ya phone number?)
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

[Verse 1: RZA]
Check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, ""Boom-boom"" the bass would blast
We was laughin' at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had began to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid you bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
Not knowin' exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
""Hey, Shorty, check it, run the bag and the dough!""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! Then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was…
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, of us laughin' all the time
I taught him all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words


[Chorus]
After laughter comes tears

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Me and my man, my ace Big Moe from the shelter
'Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma
Now, Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
He seemed to ignore, I said, ""B, for real!
She's not even worth it to go raw deal.""
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out
Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P
Ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the H.I.V
Now no life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears

Yo, the spotlight is mine, it ain't his no more
When Lee come home, niggas can't live no more

I never lounge where you find Jake
Surprise niggas like a blind date, L rhyme great
And I'ma increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'ma make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs, we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty, I cruise through Harlem in an M3
Never pay for parties, say my name and I'm in free
I'm on some 100-G car shit, superstar shit
Sellin' niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot, I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cocked, represent one block

Everywhere we go, we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome, always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is how I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop frontin' ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machete, pockets heavy, slang more cane than Eddie
I represent Uno Tres Nueve
Time is money, so I stay late
I'm quick to slide a playmate, bust off like a tre-eight then vacate

If he wasn't mine shit, I would try to claim him
Cause he's so fly, I'm so fly
You play yourself if you try to deny it, damn

I'm nothin' like the other brother
I got no choice but to slut her
Cause I'm in a tan six with a base gut
That look something like a nutta-butta duhduhduhduh
Mami you'll be in St. Tropez
Riding jet skis and mopeds, nodding like dopeheads
Paparazzi snapping pictures, they must think you J. Lopez (bitch)
Let's roast in spinach, hit a club and just post up in it
What you mean are we here yet?
I got a lear jet that gets to the west coast in minutes (hehe)
I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge and white and yellow studs
Cause if they witness how I'm killing them out here
These girls just might go tell the judge I rest my case

Who's as handsome as ghetto?
This mans earring looks transparent
And my Mitchell & Ness throwbacks be so old
They could be somebody grandparents, baby like (Damn)
I want the kind of money athletes consume
I have to assume, I'm no fool but I'm so cool
When I walk in, it feel like it's a draft in the room, Whoo (Damn)
I'm so sick, I drive in reverse pass
Call me a nurse fast
Shorty just lay back in the Maybach
Get a feel like you sitting in first class, relax


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
They ask for it
So I put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard
You got to catch it on tape cause when the truck stops
The rims still look like they on fast-forward, unh
Damn, I'm sipping liquor the colour of Smurf skin
As long as the earth spins, and you'll get seasick
And my waves be thick enough for them Cali dudes to surf in, cowabunga!
Your low riding denims look like midgets is hiding in them
They say I like it from the front, they like it from the back
But when the kids is sliding in them, they be screaming (Damn)
The biggest dykes these switching for dudes for figures like me
And um I'm not bragging
But imagine that you could even fuck wit a nigga like me

The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

[Verse 4: Paul Cain]
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
All for the love of cake


[Verse 5: Fabolous]
Baby girl, why wouldn't fellas stop ya?
After we come through the hood in helicopters (yeah)

[Verse 6: Paul Cain]
The dro I got in this wood, is hela-proper
We do the damn thing, how could they tell us not to

[Chorus: Fabolous & Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

[Verse 7: Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow Azure (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The princesses in my ear, are clear and cut right
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get at hoes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin dough


[Verse 8: Fabolous]
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
In Akademik sample velours
Hypnotic samples to pour
The European sample Azure
Wheel on the right side 'B' with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep tefs jammed in the four
Amp weed to draw, end up in a wheelchair ramp by your door

[Chorus: Fabolous & Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?)
Why wouldn't I huh? Why wouldn't I what?

[Verse 9: Fabolous]
After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is cause I got the same Nikes that Jordan had on in ""Space Jam""


[Verse 10: Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

[Verse 11: Fabolous]
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

[Verse 12: Paul Cain]
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior
(Baby girl), I got cops thats on the payroll
Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

[Verse 13: Fabolous]
Green and cream Tims, brocolli and potatoes
Why wouldn't you see the Storm for the rocks and these tornadoes

[Chorus: Fabolous & Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)

You know how we get down baby, let me tell you a lil' story

[LL Cool J]
You're not a chickenhead goin ""hee-shey""
You're choosy in the bed like ""hee-shey""
I know your man's in the feds but ""hee-shey""
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
Is it the.. invisible settings on the baguettes?
The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
Or the.. wood-grain in the convertible Lex
Be ease, shoppin sprees, what designer is next?
Is it the.. Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
Could it be I'm.. anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip
Hat low, doin donuts when I pull up out the dealership
Is it the.. the Fortune 500 covers?
The family man that got one baby mother?
The way I brainwash y'all to love one another
And got the whole community bouncin in unity

[Chorus 2X: LL Cool J] + (girl)
(Born to love you baby) Why?

Is it the.. twenty million I be grabbin a flick?
Or my four-hundred million dollar FUBU clique?
Is it the.. ""In the House"" syndication chips
Poppin two bottles, shorty read my lips
They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather
Simple ain't it... uh, but quite clever
Is it the.. fact I melt in liquid ice?
Tapped it once, you felt it twice
Is it the.. multiple O's I'm known for those
Temptation Island, wildin cause my neck froze
Is it the.. bowlegged, hard-headed
Little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?
Forget it

Is it the.. Countache rollin up to your door?  Yeah
Tell your roommate you ain't dancin no more, yeah
Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah
Tell 'em bout them twenty-thousand on tour, yeah

And it's God fearing, foreign car steering
60 thou Chopard wearing, just beat a trial hearing
You should catch me walking cocky out the courtroom (diddy bopping!)
Like eat my dust, a buck 40 for the Porsche zoom (ZOOOOOOOOOM!)
Back in population (what else?)
We cop drops to race 'em (BALLIIIING!)
We getting money over here WHAT'S YOUR OCCUPATION?!?!
We on top of things, and we got them things (them birds)
But we only sell them birds, you tryna cop a wing? (you a petty hustler)
I know the real Rich...the REAL Richard Porter
RIP he left the hood to us, we own the corners! (HARLEM!)

And my niggas moving fish scale just like the Pisces!
Momma raised a thug, lawyers when we face the judge (Kalina!)
This is the chance we take to try and put ya brain on drugs

Throwing gang signs, two stepping with our burners tucked (EASTSIIIIDE!)
And we will burn you up like three star alarm
WE ARE THE BOMB HUNDRED G'S ON THE CHARM (Byrd Gang!)
You'd think I own the cleaners how I wash that paper

Much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that
This nigga ready for war, well where that fool at?
I bruise wack rap niggas severely punish them
Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh
Always gotta be the weakest nigga out the crew
I probably make more money off yo' album, than you
You see the respect I get every time I come through
Check your own videos, you'll always be number two
Niggas talking real greasy on them R&B records
Well I'm Platinum a million times nigga, check the credits

I can even make YO' shit tighter
I roast niggas like ya, smoke niggas like ya
Take your little jewels and put the toast to niggas like ya
You know what the fuck we do and why we done it
How I bring it to niggas who, probably want it
Keep playing, you gone find me in your lobby blunted
And I don't even smoke nigga, ain't no joke

[Verse 1]
Come on the track like duh-duh-duh-duh
With a throwback jersey and a fitted
Might blow a bag of Hershey in the siddix
Or might take sips of Army with a chiddick, I'm so sick with it
Lampin' in the Hamptons
The weekends, man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermès boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old-school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?
J-A, ladies, help me say it now

She never seen a hundred on the wrist before
Never seen twenty-twos on the six before
I am killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid
'Cause the boy got more sixes than first grade
The crib got killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good)
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie B pants
Waist is low enough to let your waist show
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car
We can cruise the city doin' a buck-sixty

I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip frontin', stuntin', it's something you want
745, chrome spinners, haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot, you know I ain't stoppin'
'Til my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What, nigga? Lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me

Gotta watch my back around these niggas 'cause they funny
Twenty years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer, 'cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion, I ain't lyin'
Bounty hunters got me flying with my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder, Hennessy and soda
Hood on my shoulder, look in the mirror, I see a soldier

Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me

Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me

In these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (C'mon)

Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing

There's no way I'ma back down like a goddamn coward, I can't
How would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, woah, yo, ho
Hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you (C'mon)

If niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Yo, started with a blue whip, blue whip
Got a silver new whip, 'cause feds watch when I do shit
Keep poppin' up new shit, new shit
Keep the whole Harlem World on some Clue shit
We Cris' bub sippers, strip club niggas
Peace to the street team, y'all get love, nigga
Six years ago I was the have-not nigga
Hot nigga, represent for all my block niggas
Now I'm 6 drop niggas, baguette rock niggas
10 G's a show and I ain't even drop, niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a Pop nigga
You go against Ma$e, you get your wig rocked, nigga
Players like me'll leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop, nigga
Hustle is a hustle, so I never knock a nigga
Don't really fuck with Dame, but still I cop Jigga,


[Chorus: Ma$e & Busta Rhymes]
Yo, if niggas wanna act, we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gats, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild
If niggas wanna act, we can act
If niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Yo, I do this everyday, why brag about the glory?
Tell you the whole truth, never half the story
You wasn't no hater, you'd probably be happy for me
Billboard, first slot in every category
Niggas say they love me, they don't love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel the vibe when they hug me
Luckily, I rock jewels that be chunky
Over Iceberg Rugby, pushin' a Benz buggy
For a better batch, roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach?
I mean, um, think it's smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke, the niggas ain't cheap, they broke
Oh yeah, this my dough year
Jealousy and envy'll get you nowhere
You don't like me? Bet against me
You right, got dough, do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight, how many link, loosen my ice
And 'fore I scoop the dice, bet a grand I beat the deuce twice
Niggas who don't make dough, I can't affiliate with 'em
I'm dyin' from a sickness known as Willie-ism


[Chorus: Ma$e & Busta Rhymes]
Yo, if niggas wanna act, we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gats, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild
If niggas wanna act, we can act
If niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap

If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild

We can do
We can do it better
And you niggas wanna scrap? We can scrap

Oh how times have changed…[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
I'm a straight gorilla with it, cold-hearted killer with it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it (Yeah)
I make it hot, motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, 32-shot clip in my snorkel (Uh-huh)
I might smile and say, ""What's up?"" but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas (Woo)
I'm on the edge, I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap—what you looking at, pussy?
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play, but I'm a playa 'til the motherfucking end

[Chorus]
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes (Hahaha)
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)

And when I open that door, bitch get in my car


[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you don't know that, ah—I'm the shit
Now, you better watch your girl, man, I leave with your bitch
I ain't stunting these hoes, man, I'm 'bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga, I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my Jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her makeup (Uh-huh)
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob (Woo)
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey (Yeah)
Spent her life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh... nah, not likely
Went out with Vivica, I thought
I was onto something
But then the next week, nah
Man, it was nothing (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)

Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie (Uh-huh)
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love; then, it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needle's in your arm (Uh-huh)
It's a cold world, baby girl, loving me is not enough
Find out when you fucking broke, love won't get you on the bus (Yeah)
Man, you should see the pretty bitches that be sexing me
They suck cock; to make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me (Woo)
Hundred percent thug, freak, too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouth's full, baby, huh?
My conversation's so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawning, turning over, and I'm in your bed

Grr

[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Verse 1: DMX]
It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
'Til I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strong-arm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein' crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin' cats just as broke as myself
Livin' foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, 'cause niggas talk about goin' out of state
Money got an eighth, comin' back hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate, nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doin bad
Will be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down


[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Verse 2: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon
Gots to take a block and make it boom
We comin' through, so make some room
Found somethin' that could be somethin' if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
The purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the morning, we on the block creepin'
Killin' the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin'
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
'Cause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ah)
You think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po-po, nigga keep a .44


[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Verse 3: DMX]
I spend my money on niggas, 'cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin' shit but suckin' my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas over six blocks, makin' the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin' what they been wantin'
And we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin'
Stick up kids huntin', but I ain't got no love for 'em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for 'em
Them motherfuckin' knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they really tryin' to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump from the alley, and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin' 'em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit
Ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem, 'cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (Why, nigga?)
'Cause I'm a hustlin' motherfucker, and I'm holdin' my block down


[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

Get in that ass quick-fast like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada, fuck Poppa
You gotta call me Francis M.H

Was told in shootouts, stay low and keep firin'
Keep extra clips for extra shit (Uh-huh)

Ain't no tellin' where I may be
May see me in D.C.

Fuckin' somethin', you should know my steelo:
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen befo', so
Jesus! Get off the Notorious'

If the beef between us, we can settle it with the chrome and metal shit

You're delicate, you better get — who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure

Should I start your breath, or should I let ya die?
In fear, you start to cry, ask why, lyrically I'm

You cursed it but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit, you herbs get
Stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin', I punish 'em (Uh-huh), I'm done with them (Uh-huh)
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them, 'cause they nothin' but dicks
Tryna blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro, rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, layin' wit' yo' bitch
I know you prayin' you was rich, fuckin' prick, when I see ya, I'ma...

Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you

And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip

So I can rip through the ligaments

Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore

Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like...) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, After the Death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is


[Chorus]
Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (C'mon)

My poetry's deep, I never fell

No doubt! (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like...) Sex to a nympho, but nothin' sweet
I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin' somethin' deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like bein' locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin' a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down, and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance, with the fat booty pants – hot damn!
""What's your name, love? Where you came from?""
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica –
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up


Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Aiyyo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (""Say word!"")
Yo, it's the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (""Yeah, that's her"")
Shocked as hell, she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
""How you feelin'?"" ""Oh, I'm fine,"" ""My name is Mos,"" ""I'm Sharice""
""I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet""
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance wit' me?""

[Chorus]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget


[Interlude]
She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, ""Word?!""
I played it low though
I was like, ""Yeah, aight, come on then, let's go...""
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just...
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond – to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me...

[Verse 2]
""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But, baby, you know what it's like –
Some brothers don't be comin' right""
""I understand, I'm feelin' you –
Besides, 'Can I have a dance?' ain't really that original""
We laughed about it, traipsed her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished, and she whisper, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""

Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singing Gregory Isaacs
Like – ""If I don't, if I don't have you...""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man – I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O. – ""Come now,"" I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, ""Sweetheart, I got to have it""
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic – gahdamn it!
My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My ""911""'s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, ""I saw Sharice at the Kitty Club
With some bangin' ass Asian, playin' 'lay it down and lick me up'""
""What?!!""


[Outro]
Can you believe that shit, dude?
G, I was like... ""what???""
Ohhh, man, I was so sick, I was sooo sick, yo
I ha--I had no idea, that shit caught me like, ""Baow!""
Fucked up in the game, man – I was really feeling shorty...",Ten Crack Commandments,The Notorious B.I.G.

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Ayo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure


[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up bless
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent


[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, god, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Chorus]
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
[Outro]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life in every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Dime, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Drawz, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD
And my man Preemo from Gang Starr

Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!

In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bombin' hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N, double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs
Sure enough, I keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seem they tryna take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases (Hm)
Bitches, get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down (Biatch)
Uh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage, I've got
Nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerino
I've got a house out in the hills, right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal, uh
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the ki's, motherfucker
Now, follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's

Now give me fifty feet, defeat is not my destiny
Release me to the streets and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid
They tell me not to roll with my Glock, so now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Baitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots

Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real, to them, it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meaning of raw
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps, I truly care
'Cause without some of them, I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal

I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check, one, two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Give me a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you, it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time, I'm gonna get ya
'Cause I be kickin' the real
While they be losin' the race, tryin' to chase mass appeal

Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination madе my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to gеt the dough off
Stickin' up white boys on ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-tight clique and went all out
Catchin' ki's from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPVs, every week we made forty G
Yo, brothas, respect mine or here go the TEC-9, ch-pow
Move from the gate now

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin'
But I'm alive on arrival, I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause **** deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed, I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not touch (Touch)
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask, what's it worth?
Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young Black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound, we rocked it
'96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?

And the enemy is one-time

Milli' stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop

Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)

Where I'm from it ain't Iraq but swear to God it get real like it
Got soldiers in the field like it, bout mine, you get killed like it
Pussy niggas be commentating, say they ain't hating but it feel like it
Just post a pic of me and his boo on Instagram, think he'll like it


[Hook]
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I ain't a chef I make meals like him, cut them up in thin slices
I got bricks like constructions
You want instructions? You niggas ain't built like me
Competition ain't real like me, I'm so sick, who ill like me?
Two bitches in my suite, so when I leave I bet them bitches still diking
Family good cause I feel like it, I'm hood cause I feel like it
Might not be your favorite artist
But your favorite artist got a verse from me, so they still like it
Ain't nobody popping seals like me, codeine like a supplement
If I make her cum it's a compliment, nigga fuck you, like a parking ticket
Now I got 'caine, like a walking stick, shoot you for a argument
Make all my bitches take all your bitches and play hide and get
I'm getting rich cause I feel like it, take your girl cause I feel like it
Cash her out, toss her up, wash her up that's the spin cycle
And them niggas never did like it, in the car and I got the title
Grandma bought me a hand bible, I bought me a hand rifle
Cause I feel like it, all you niggas look re-cycled
And I'm getting head in the car, while she's driving


[Hook]
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it

(I got bitches all on my back)
(I got niggas all in my face)
(It get serious it ain't no game)
(So I got to keep that thing on my waist)

[1st Verse: Havoc]
Which part of ""no games"" niggas don't understand
You're dealing with one-dead-serious-black-man
Whose first resort's to squeeze, second thought to breath
Love this freedom so you know how I be
And why these niggas want to pull me in?
I ask myself that same question over and over again
It's a small world my girl, I'm smashing a friend
Ain't no love lost might as well join the fuck in
I've been telling niggas how my gangster get
You can trace it all the way back to The Infamous
When niggas out now was on infamil
Fuck a hotel nigga was fogging a windshield
Wrecking my first wheel they was barely bulking
Now this dun language is the motivation of their talking
A hate in my blood you won't find one drop
But let a nigga stunt and he will get dropped, so


[Hook]

[2nd Verse: Prodigy]
Yo, dun what up? scream at your dog
These niggas been wilding since niggas been gone
Fake niggas stunt like they really that strong
You really that bitch nigga, pussy, thongs
P' that nigga that'll break your jaw
You get jumped by a mobb of niggas for sure
You get cut, bucked and left for dead
We get fucked, sucked and extra bead
Partying with the ladies is crazy dic
Make you want to have babies and eat the fish
You won't feel safe in the same place as us
We make niggas want to stay far away from us
We make bitches panties wet, they pray for us
Want to see a nigga live and be safe and such
We back with more of that Murda Muzik, bitch
My gun'll bang on a nigga that confuse the shit

That thing is closer than blood and thicker than water
(You niggas is like fleas and the guns pluck 'em off, dun)
Scratch that itch then get rid of that bitch

That's when beautiful whip we tearing the streets up

Wealth, health, and happiness nigga
Will Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas
Sometimes you gotta just handle your business
Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas
Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral ceilings
Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars
Livin' like the pharaoah Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to C-Span, see the elite strength
Attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass
We gotta survive this shit dunn, it's nothin' to laugh at (For real)
I hops in the V, grab the heat and I stash that
I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap

[Chorus: Havoc]
I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself
You got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death, I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? C'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees


[Verse 2: Havoc]
Saw alot of niggas die, some niggas survived
And those that did did it by the skin of their hide
Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em
And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em
On the real, for me to be here tellin' ya'll this
Is like dice, then I rolled that 456
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, a lot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain (That's right)
And for a nigga's problems had no one to point the blame (Right)
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line, them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad (That bad)
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B
And it's real

Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself

I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'mma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker
Dawg, you was his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin', jumpin' out of bed
Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the carpets

Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home

Turn the fuckin' beat on!
Ha!!! Yeah! We back!
S.P.! I had to switch back to Dom Perignon
(The king of this rap, baby! Used to have to cock-and-run just to stay in the business!)
Son of a bitch! Double R (Look at me now, motherf...!)
2001, 'Kiss The Game Goodbye'! (Let's get it on!)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
It's the J-A-D-A, I got beef with the Feds and the DA
I got footage of the game, press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me – ma, take it ea-sy
And y'all scared, I can tell
That I'ma get Bucks like Milwaukee, 'cause like Sam, I ca' sell
I'm that nigga – y'all know that
Bang you in the yard, then slide off on the early go-back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes, so say cheese
I already told you, I'm lookin' for enemies
Double R – so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle, read the letter
Money in the bank, membership, Visa sweaters
And we ride or D-I-E together

[Hook]
Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down
Come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down


Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down
Come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is? Ask ya ho
The honeys don't lie, they love it
And they cop for real – trust me, dawg, the thugs'll dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore, nobody never gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through, off the books
So when you mention my name, shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know if I'm there, hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club, ice over the thermal
Waitin' for you to try me; when the lights get low, I'ma burn you
Start with straight shots, and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats, then pop models
Gotta slay two or more, ma, that's our motto
And y'all might can get down with the team if y'all swallow

[Hook]
Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down
Come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down


Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down
Come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
(Muahh) Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong? Change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king, and scoop the queen
And take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy, pants saggin', I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash?
Never did a day and got the jails on smash – K-I-double
I move the perico quick, and let the manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start workin'
Now put ya hands up 'til ya'll arms start hurtin'
Don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed'll find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want
But soon as the hook come back, put 'em up!

Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down

And I been had one so don't forget that
357 Magnum wit no kickback
Put 'em all in your six pack for a big stack
And I never keep the money where I keep the clips at
Violate and get you one in your throat
You still datin your heat, but me and my guns elope
When I die bury me with the toast
In case I run into a little bit of drama wherever I go
And I won't hesitate, make you levitate
Hit you with the titanium, 38, and it's featherweight
Bullets like good dope how I keep 'em coming
Kill a couple niggas then everybody want 'em
Who gon' shoot and who gon' brawl
If push comes to shove everybody know, you gon' fall
And I got mine on me
The automatic or the 40 cali, or even the black Glock nine on me

That'll knock down the door and break up the steps
Don't even bother wearin a vest
Cuz these ain't the kinda slugs that's gon' get lodged in your chest
Gotta nighttime scope that could see through the walls
So just to get shit crackin I'mma tear up your dog
I'mma show you what's dumbin out
And you could believe whatever I shoot it's comin off or comin out
And don't even try runnin out
Cuz the 44 mag'll leave your ass by another house
This is Jadakiss, I'm sprayin everything I see in my radius
The kids stay blazin shit

Guns and the sneakers made Jada
The bitches and the reefer came later with the money and the haters
But I'm a humble kid
Still put the pump in your baby mother mouth make her mumble where you live
25 years no felony I'm tellin y'all
Why you think I saved it, to blow a nigga melon off
As a young boy always carried a cap gun
Fell in love wit it first time I clapped one
Now I'm a grown man more mature and pleasant
And like hittin niggas in the jaw with the desert
And everybody got a gun, why not me
You gotta keep it on you now it's just like I.D
And I never seen a man cry til I seen a man shot
Fuck pride, bullets is too damn hot
So if you ain't got one then you gotta run
Handle it, or tell the whole world that...

Yo, we down in Vegas, money, skies too courageous
I know I'm on the run, but still rip stages

Beanie (Mack B****),Beanie Sigel,"1 ContributorBeanie (Mack B****) LyricsYou know my name, bitch
Uhh.. yeah.. hold up
The streets gave me heat, and the Eagle was the thing that they gave me
It's the rap guerilla that still clap.. fucka
Yeah, guess who's back?

(Verse 1)
Mack, bitch - I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks from towns
Move out with small Glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table bag and rock it down
Fuck who watchin now; the neighbors, they in pocket now
Fuck you haters cop some pocket now
When it come to coke you can't outwit me, mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boyar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour siffin it up
Coke spots runnin by the hour shiftin it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas goin ape in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble

(Chorus)
BEANIEEEEEEEE! Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIEEEEEEEE! Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIEEE, BEANIEEE - Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIEEEEEEEE! Yeah, but guess who back


(Verse 2)
It's Mack, bitch - uh-huh, back in the mix or the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Boxman, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxin
You will lay, nigga I'm not playin
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eatin with my dog like when we break-fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Sheeit when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You bout, four-thirty cheap in wheels - small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sittin in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smokin
64 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Mack, aiyyo
On the low doe (shh!) the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes (yeah)
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, BULLSHIT
You switch to hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wastin your time spittin the rhymes
I'm gettin mine spittin them rhymes, but still pitchin them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calmin the sound
Stick with the seven, strickly smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm poppin for keeps -
I'm not gettin stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga tryin to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract

Hey yo Mase, you know what I don't like?
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
I don't like when, you know, I'm in a club
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
And I'm with my honey
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
You got, you know, the haters
They wanna be tough guys all of a sudden

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

[Puff talking over Chorus]
Hit you with the ice grill, you know
Haha, 'cause your boys ain't with you
Little do they know, the girl roll harder than
Some of yo' niggas
You dig?

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws?
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors
I was Murda, P. Diddy made me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy
Niggas on the block know Mase motto
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough
'98 Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe
Case I'm ever chased by Donnie Brasco

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Yo, I can't get mad 'cause you look at me
'Cause on the real, look at me
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear
Dissin' every year, but they better listen here
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on your own
'Cause bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus it won't be long 'til they send me the dome
Sit gently while I'm on the Bentley phone
Why you don't like me, 'cause I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy your wifey?
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
CD, TV's, really would I know ya?
Now me and Blink float in a gold Rover
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
'Cause Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it


[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me

We was all at the Greek Fest, it's hot and sandy
I rent scooters, I'm with my family
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy
But get approached by a girl named Tammy
Who look good enough to be Miss Miami
But say since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's
""He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?""
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem, you can meet me at 10
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie
And please no hickies, 'cause wifey's with me

Turn ya children into orphans tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realest shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it, when I finish, I'ma slit my throat

Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga

They came to the light, a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and Fam-Lay's gon' fry
'Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what? War against a army with a handgun

I'm running with it, on e'ry song, I'm coming with it
See some of you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See, I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try to diss us
See you in the streets, it ain't nothin' to discuss, man

Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if they part of your set?
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death?
Yeah, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around, only give you eight months for a burner?
It's goin' down; why they sellin' niggas' CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan

Why you don't stack instead of tryin' to be fly?
Why is rattin' at an all time high? Why are you even alive? (Why?)
Why they kill 2Pac and Chris?
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Cris? (Oh, why?)

Why they stop lettin' niggas get degrees in jail?

Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over, why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?

Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but be sellin' the least? why

I'll be by your side, I'll always find a way
General, we got these niggas
Fucking cockroaches, you wanna go to war? HA-HAAAEEH!
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 1]
(By your side)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long
They can't stop me, even if my brakes was on
I'm still (by your side)
I'm always here, nobody’s perfect, life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck, I ain't always care
When it’s too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right (by your side)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right (by your side)
Where I’m supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it’s the right or the wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team (by your side)


[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 2]
As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever homie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy, right (by your side)
As soon as something happen to you
Your niggas are bouncin' and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc right (by your side)
Puttin tubes in you
And you can’t even eat right, they puttin’ food in you
Your body’s getting colder, Devil on your shoulder
And your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her (by your side)
Nothin but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and y'all under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front
At least I'm gonna be (by your side)


[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 3]
Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor: stick to our little plan
And fuck the money, just keep my little man (by your side)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he know how it's going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store, show him the loafs
Hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right (by your side)
You know Kiss
Don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be (by your side)
The answer's plenty
'Cause when you, handling business you can't be friendly
And if you, tryin to stack something can't be pennies
Most likely Grants and Benjies
And you better keep 'em (by your side)


[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, Dipset, uh
C'mon, fuck with your boy
It's Santana, Heatmakerz, where we at?
Let me see you through this
Killa, Jones, Freekey
Yeah man, I'm back at it, come on

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm ""Gone til' November"" (Yeah)
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up (Of course)
Call my bird, get my broad, have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggas, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please, yeah)
I see a town I'm liking
See some niggas getting money in a town: I like it (Yeahhh)
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like, ""It's my block now, alright, kid?"" (Whoa)
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out
And rang out the side of his right ear (Woo!)
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that Pyrex Vision
Pot, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitching (What)
Yeah, I'm sorry, but this is how I'm living
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!


[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone, watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home, hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (Say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching 'Shaft', clocking math

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high; will I survive?
In the city where the skinny niggas die
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year, so, okay, okay, okay
Y'all can't fuck with me – no way, José, or Héctor Camacho
TEC blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker, I'm the best, I told y'all before
I showed y'all before, ay!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone, watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home, hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (Say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching 'Shaft', clocking math


[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa (Killa...)
I'm on the west side of Chicago, looking for a bust-down
Don't make me put my two arms up, touchdown! (What up, ma?)
You stay in touch now, but when I touch down
I'm like Buckshot, shorty, Duck Down
Yeah, I must clown, I'm from Harlem, Uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, ""What now?""
Birds flip a dozen, chicks, it's dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, Toya's kissing muffin
Worse than that, they go home and kiss they husband (Shit's foul)
The shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons bugging
This on my wrist is nothing
Yeah, it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhyming
You fucking with Pablo, bravo
Mario Villabona, hoe, ta'to

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone, watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home, hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels

What's the deally, yo?
I gotta squeeze the juice outta the headphones
(Jadakiss...)
Yeah (L.O.X.)
Squeeze the juice outta the headphones
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
When you think of me you think of a problem
Who? What? When? and how you gonna solve 'em
Automatic or revolving
The K I double S and, Here's the lesson
Most beams is infrared, but mines is fluorescent
No matter where you go, I'ma spot you
No matter how many people you put me in front of, I'ma rock you
And if you try to be the hard top, I'ma drop you
I got to, treat you like the clutch, and pop you
Creep through in the 4-20 with your honey
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a playboy that turned bunny
And the only the thing left to discuss is more money
In these bullshit games these chickens, try to run me
Y'all know y'all can't touch us, I flow luscious
It's so real I make her hop out, and get the dutches
I'm sittin' on a thousand birds, and I hide from the cameras (Why?)
'Cause a picture's worth a thousand words
And y'all herbs, y'all get what y'all deserve
Y'all do the catering while we just get served
And you got some nerve for P-H-in' Jason
Do you have any idea who you facin'?
Just something about my shit, you'll never figure out
It's too hot, burning my mouth, that's why I spit it out
It must be real hard for y'all to listen
And it's sad, niggas is too broke to pay attention


[Chorus]
Chillin', sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing
Chillin', sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing

[Verse 2]
Ayo, niggas know the line of work, bulletproof designer shirt
Rolling with a China Doll, she'll be reminding y'all
Don of the underworld, every block monitored of course
Jadakiss and L-O-X boss
A pro 'cause I grow off the shit that I absorb
You just another so and so, tryin' to flow, going broke
You tryna buy property, set it up for growing coke
Niggas making a movie, so I came to edit
Wiping everybody out, right before the credits
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, I flip into the wrong shit
The prime artist, expect me to rhyme hardest
Slash con artist, gonna get mine regardless
I ain't even big and I size niggas up
'Cause they eyes give 'em up, look at 'em and see they butt
I'm 22 with 10 in, so there that go
You hear that flow that drove the underground wacko
Ever since 12 I've been spittin' like tobacco
Relax though, pop the tape CD and the wax, though
They wonder how, but the thing about ours
We open up 24 hours
Niggas don't sleep or eat, so when they speak it mean power
So you should keep quiet, you a coward
About to be laid out flat, and pushing up flowers


[Chorus]
Chillin', sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing
Chillin', sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion

Holler (Yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
My break, I'm fresh off it
I never change, I'm stuck in these ways, Nike Airs, sweats and Taurus (Huh?)
But I'ma do it for my enemies
They wanna end my chill, wanna see what that villa be
Now, what that sound like?
Plus, they know what a clip get down like
Turn bags from bladders, legs to wheels, pain and pills
'Cause you fucking with a nigga that'll jump out, wave the steel
I live this way, it's real, dog, it's no joke
Blow smoke in your bitch face, piss on your wheels
Slap your custies, clap your worker, dead the strip
Stick your connect, yap your bitch
So let it be known, I'm back on my grizzly
The sergeant, the cap, the MAC holds sixty
For rookies and vets, I'll bang 'til it click (Click)
So run and tell your dude that the Ruger come with two clips, dog
M-Easy, won't leave, my hood need me
Pop for sheezy, who don't believe me?

Me and my Roc killer fam, top billers, man (Man)
We run the spots, drop ceilings, fam (Fam)
Hit the wall, drop ceiling fans (Uh)
Listen, boy, man, I show you how to fill a van up with killers, man
And line the trunk, keep a stash box for the nine and the pump
The coach walk you through and he grind you up
What you want, the dope or the weed?
How you wan' package it, in the cap or the bag?
How you want me packing, with the MAC or the mag?
Yeah, that Bent' get back, but listen, scrap, act real fast
And keep a wack that'll gag your back
Block style from your swagger, your swacks
It's the Broad Street Bully, bitch
Bully niggas on the broadest streets
I house niggas on the narrowest block
Know my rules when the barrel get hot
When the gun blows, and the shots fall, and the smoke clear
Man, I be hearin' you were murdered (You ain't here)
Nobody hit up in the cross 'cause I'm observin' (You ain't here)
Nobody be missin' your loss 'cause you deserved it
South Philly niggas kill at will
I keep my MAC-milli chilly chill (Uh)
On the really real 'fore I make you niggas feel this steel (Killa, Killa)


[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Go 'head, stupid niggas, go fuck with them chicks (Yeah)
I'm the third little piggy, I'ma fuck with them bricks (Bricks)
Better yet, the bakery, I got pies and cakes (Cakes)
Nigga think doublin' is turnin' five to eight
I turn eight to twenty, twenty to a hundred, hundred to thousand
That to a hundred thousand (Thousand)
In front of housin' (Housin')
Closed the mall down, dog, no one's allowed in (Allowed in)
I'm coppin' everything, I'm done with browsin' (Give me that)

Olha, eu acredito em dinheiro, poder e respeito
Primeiro você consegue o dinheiro, depois você consegue a porra do poder
Depois de conseguir a porra do poder, os filhos da puta vão te respeitar (Qual é a chave pra vida?)

[Refrão: Lil' Kim]
Dinheiro, poder e respeito é o que você precisa na vida
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, você vai comer direito
Dinheiro, poder e respеito, você pode dormir à noite
Você vai ver a luz, qual é a chavе pra vida?
Dinheiro, poder e respeito é o que você precisa na vida
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, você vai comer direito
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, dinheiro, poder e respeito

[Verso 1: Sheek Louch e Lil' Kim]
Ayo, toda a minha turma quer isso, quer isso
Pegamos o de vocês enquanto vocês fazem biquinho
SUV, saiam da frente, as vadias querem se aglomerar em volta
Você poderia me ver na TV Optimum
Vá até o seu banheiro apagar a luz
Grite, ""Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3""
O Sheek não é o seu amigo de sempre
Mas eu poderia te arrumar igual o Keyser e andar direto até o final
Eu tô cansado de diamantes e amuletos
Eu tô tentando cravejar o meu caixão inteiro quando eu for embora
Venha com classe até o Don, assim que eu encontrar eles, eu cumprimento
Beije os pés dele pela liberdade, fala pra eles, ""Obrigado Senhor""
Porque na Terra eu tava ficando entediado
Agora me ressuscite de volta nesse gato chamado Sheek
Pra que eu possa fazer esse álbum e receber de volta os caras que são fracos
Duas e meia, seis, dois
Eu me mexer por você? Isso é tipo um gato contra um pitbull
Arma, saiba que o pente tá cheio, mantenho com fome
E planeje pro futuro, porque você acha que vai ficar mais velho
Muito mais tempo do que vai ser jovem (Qual é a chave pra vida?)


[Refrão: Lil' Kim]
Dinheiro, poder e respeito é o que você precisa na vida
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, você vai comer direito
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, você pode dormir à noite
Você vai ver a luz, qual é a chave pra vida?
Dinheiro, poder e respeito é o que você precisa na vida
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, você vai comer direito
Dinheiro, poder e respeito, dinheiro, poder e respeito

[Verso 2: Styles P e Lil' Kim]
Só o tempo poderia dizer como o relógio marca
Eu sou realmente amado aqui, mas ainda sou um refém
Duas personalidades, observe a postura
Fumaça saindo da boca, limpando as narinas
Penso na morte, mas a vida parece ser assustadora
Eu tô passando por cemitérios vendo pessoas, Ave Maria
Eu não vou relaxar até sair do paraquedas
Escalo a montanha com meu mano por cerca de dez diamantes
Vinte e cinco mil por peça, foda-se as ruas
Tô tentando ser o dono da ilha, esqueço os selvagens
Tento andar no carro que tá flutuando
Se eu te mostrasse onde moro, você ia achar que eu tava me escondendo
Pau de estilingue pras garotas que não falam Inglês
Acordo na Trinidad tipo, ""Foda-se, eu sou rico""
Volto, jatinho particular, vivo no set
Se você pode cagar ouro, então eu posso cuspir baguettes (Qual é a chave pra vida?)

[Verso 3: Jadakiss e Lil' Kim]
Nada além de gostosura sempre que tocamos essa
O monótono é pra vocês que continuam odiando, porque vocês nunca vão parar a gente
Eu mantenho as minhas pedras perfeitas e as minhas putas de topless
Faça no seu tempo, tente descobrir quem é o The Lox
Não tenho medo de ninguém, mando rimas como Xoguns
Você tá com medo de atirar, ser roubado com a sua própria arma
Se eu não te respeitar, eu vou verificar você
E se eu não te beijar, eu vou te bicar
Bem antes de te molhar, eu espirro nas faixas e te abençoo
Eu sou especial e se você gosta de malhar, então eu te vou alongar
O tráfico tá morto, mas ainda ficamos vermelhos
Transformo os pontos em padarias pra recuperar o pão
E vocês falaram que o meu dinheiro foi gasto, mas tá no Bent'
Então, quando os federais chegarem, os cachorros não vão conseguir sentir o cheiro
E a minha história, autoexplicativa
Que eu sou o cara mais quente na rua
E vocês não são nada pra mim (Qual é a chave pra vida?), yeah

[Verso 4: DMX e Lil' Kim]
Esse é um beat que eu posso enlouquecer, apenas solte o carretel
Abençoe um cara com o mal, esses caras conhecem as minhas habilidades
X nos grills deles, acerto eles, divido eles
Molho e observo eles virem buscar
Arrumo eles, quando você joga sujo, você fica sujo
Vadia, eu vou fazer a sua buceta doer, dê um passo pra trás tipo, ""Eu trabalhei""
Isso não é a porra de um jogo, o que, você acha que eu tô brincando?
Até você se deitar em algum lugar no ferro-velho decadente
Sua mãe tá em casa rezando pra que você volte pra casa, mas não vai
Porque você tá deitado no porta-malas, começando a apodrecer
E o inferno é quente, eu sei porque tô aqui agora, baby
Tá acontecendo, baby, pego a .45, baby
E fuzilo um cara
Especialmente se ele achar que é maior do que a porra do meu gatilho
Olho mágico, eu posso pegar o meu? Ele se foi?
O DMX tá representando mais uma vez, colocando a gente na ativa (Qual é a chave pra vida?)

For you baby, I'd find you
For you baby, I'd find you

[Verse 1: The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she (Wouldn't get far) 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that (Far), how you get that (Far)
And all these new video bitches tryin' to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

[Chorus: The Game]
(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your legs closed
(It would be just a waste of time)
But you know, (You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me?
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from a team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O?
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo?
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo?
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'?
But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio, yo

And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyoncé from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'

I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo

You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

It samples Raphael Ravencroft’s —… Read More [Intro: Beanie Sigel]
(I can feel it in the air)
My Spidey-Senses is tinglin'
Feel something (Got my radars up)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, doot-doot, doot-doot
(I can feel it in the air)

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Somethin' going on, I feel funny
Can't tell me nothin' different (Different), my nose twitchin' (Twitchin')
Intuition setting in like Steve vision (Uh)
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind (Mind)
So what I do? I still take heed, I still listen (Listen)
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism, my words still skippin'
Through air, I know you can't, don't, won't get it (You square)
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat
I ain't the captain of the yacht, but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will, but I know you won't (You won't, man)
I read between the lines of the eyes and your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile, aha, you niggas foul

[Chorus: Melissa Jiménez & Beanie Sigel]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air (I don''t know man, I just feel something man)
I can hear it in your voice (Something ain't right man)
I can feel it in the air (They gon'... on you )


[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers (Hammers)
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me (Vests on me), two TECs, extra clips on me (Clips on me)
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me (Damn)
I ain't schiz', homie (Homie), ain't nobody drop a mick on me (Mick on me)
It's like they tryin' plot and sit on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like, ""Mack, tighten up your circle before they hurt you""
Read they body language (Body language)
85% communication nonverbal
85% swear they know you, 10% (You know they story)
Man, the other five, time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master (Puppet master)
Fuck them other bastards (Man), man, watch who you puffin' after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you still amongst those stars

[Chorus: Melissa Jiménez]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air (I ain't scared, nigga I ain't goin' nowhere)
I can hear it in your voice (Can you feel it?)
I can feel it in the air (Can you feel me?)

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'? (Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'?)
Foul preacher quotin' (Foul preacher quotin')
Scriptures from Revelation, was talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body gettin' stiff (Stiff), soul levitatin' (Levitatin')
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me? As for my sins
No one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parkin'
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka
Same Uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same Lorcin
Damn, I feel it in the air, you not sincere
Nigga, it ain't an ""us"" or ""we"" or a ""I'ma"" thing
It's a good/bad karma thing, this a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something, honestly


[Chorus: Melissa Jiménez]
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it, I can feel it)
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (Ooh, yeah)
I can hear it in your voice (Ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air (I can, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (Yeah, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it in the air)
I can hear it in your voice (Ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark, let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth, baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

Before I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holler 'cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin' up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me, now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me, now

But now them same hoes beggin' me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin' pens, workin' my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out more than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with four or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin' baller, she would
Want a nigga now, but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me

They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick
'Cause they see me on the rise, and know now my paper thick

Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself (Let's get it)

Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ay)

You can find me on the block disobeyin' the law

Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit

You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic

And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put up in the hills, yeah
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl, ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart

So I'm not racin', I'm just sprintin'
'Cause I don't wanna finish (Wanna finish)
They diminish, I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world, ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30 (12:30)
​​​a.m., weigh them, if they short, take them
Right back and spray him, amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thing
Yeah, believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see, I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em 'til some fell
I'm just repel 'em, I'ma kill 'em, someone tell 'em I'ma kill 'em
I'ma fill 'em up, his mama can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'ma kill 'em and, yeah, we sell 'em, I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki' go for twenty, half a ki' go for eleven
After me there, will be nothing
I am legend and I Will Smith

Heh, c'mon, just a snare and a 808
Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A. 
Okay, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle from giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350, tank never empty
Damn, everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy, was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'ma take it one-two, way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool, as I blew by you
Hello, hi, you, I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you, feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing, I show and prove and show improvement
And I know just to go into it, could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you wanna do it, we can do it like we late
Ayy, wait, Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

And I will eat you alive

Damn, I'ma get in a nigga chest like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fucking ram
On the hunt for the lamb, I'ma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam, hair nappy like Pam
Nigga, fuck your plan, fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man and fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh, goddamn, there's my sample
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared, suck my dick
With red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos
And I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat, bitch


[Chorus]
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now what's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, they say

Stepped On My J'z,Nelly,"24 ContributorsStepped on My J’z Lyrics[Intro: Jermaine Dupri & Nelly]
Uh
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, haha (Uh, uh, listen)
Y'all know what this is (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Nelly & Jermaine Dupri]
We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall (Mall)
Just so we could be the first ones with 'em on (Come on)
Returned to school by lunchtime like, ""Nigga, what now?""
And today we in the club like, ""Nigga, what now?""
You better look down 'cause I, I know you see 'em (Say what?)
I know ya see 'em (Say what?), I know ya see 'em
I paid a thousand for the jeans, I paid two hundred for the shoes
And fuck a shirt, I'ma rock these tattoos (Uh-huh)
You see my fitted man, I represent the crib
'Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
(I) might pop my grill in, (And I) might let my chain hang
(And I) might wrap my wrist dang (Go on, Derrty, do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (Say what?), but I pay
And if I want I rock a different year of J's every day (Uh)
A different style, different color is a must, but I
It's all good until I get my first scuff, and I'm like

[Chorus: Nelly & Jermaine Dupri]
Hell naw, ain't no way (What's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (What?)
Stepped on my J's
He done stepped on my J's
These just came out
He done stepped on my J's (Stop)
Hell naw, ain't no way (What's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (What?)
Stepped on my J's
He done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit
He done stepped on my J's


[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, I-I-I got 'em all (got 'em all) but they don't get no run
Like them 13's, 7's, number fo' and the 1's
I like, how they look with Dickies, how do Levi lay on 'em?
If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin' color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black 11's with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin' in the mirror
Straight thinkin' 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (Body got)
You can't hold 'em back, homie, you gotta rock (You gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon
I know when they comin'; number, color, everything that's happenin'
You know, a different style, a different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

[Chorus: Nelly & Jermaine Dupri]
Hell naw, ain't no way (What's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (What?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (Uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (What's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (What?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's


[Verse 3: Ciara]
I-I-I-I see you lil' daddy you look sexy with them J's on
I pull up in the drop and step out with them things on
I got me the black and pink patent leather with the grey
Matchin' with the skinny jeans off with the shades
I know you see me (I know you see me), my jeans be never slippin' (Slippin')
The paparazzi, I might stop and take a picture in 'em
(Yeaah), we be fresh every day
And if you lookin' for me, lil' daddy, you can find me in the A, A, A, A
[Verse 4: Nelly & Jermaine Dupri]
I got the Retro 1's, uhh
(Then I bought the) 2's (and the) 3's (and the) 4's (uhh)
I had to order these, you can't find them in the store (nope)
Called up my stylist like, ""Shorty, send more""
And if you would please send 'em to me out on tour
(Uh-uh, uh-uh) They be here in a minute, man
See, I got that connect where I can damn near get like anythang
Plus all my hoes on 'em, then I'mma stroll on 'em
I call my hook-up at the store like ""Put a hold on 'em""
Them Carolina number 9's matchin' patent leather wristbands
Patent leather number 11's, we call 'em Space Jams
You in my space man, I'mma make you jump man
I'll make you jump, the jump, the jump, jump man
See on my weekends, my J's play a part
I'm rockin' these to the club and these to the park
I'm puttin' these on now and these here tomorrow
A spare off in my car, just in case I catch a scar


[Chorus: Nelly & Jermaine Dupri]
Hell naw, ain't no way (What's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (What?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's

Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sight seein', we might be in
The quattroporte or the new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester, she transfer to Florida State
Cookin' like Home EC for financial aid
I helped her out, she had problems with financial aid
Remember? Mean time our finance is straight
I even up the doors to the financial estates (Ross)
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced, spendin' nights in Milan
We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather

Why you lookin' for the others when you got the best?

A black Steinbrenner, who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell 'em I said it
He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think ya ass fine as shit
And that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
She replied, ""I like to do the wild thing""
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place

Knocked ya man off the clothes line sweater

But you make it look glamorous
Cause them strapped heels aren't for amateurs
Wrist quite rocky, talk like Foxy

Walk like Aki, that means sexy

Fly with me, get high as me

Jaded,Doomtree,"3 ContributorsJaded Lyrics[Dessa]
Pose with a cigarette just to see who lights it first
Aw love you didn’t think the pirouettes would lift your skirt?
On the phone with a close friend whose name you don’t know
Something bigger came up baby
So sad you can’t go
It’s amazing what they let you get away with in dim light
And it’s crazy watching you go pale in stage lights
The handbills, the fan mail
The photos that they shoot
You show up just to look at them lookin’ at you
You’ve got that gold touch
You’ve got that mad rush of the bored and over-lonely
Adored by young strangers, a stranger to old friends
You came up quick and now you’ve got the bad bends
Can’t remember which houses you live in which ones you visit
Business is different than what you envisioned, isn’t it?
All this cause and not an effect yet
Just gauze and Percocet
Bump the set 'till God can hear it
And quell this fear that I’m feeling that heaven is quite deaf

[Hook: Cecil Otter]
And all I hear is
King me
Love me
Watch me
Did he love me
Honey kiss me
Is she off me
Naughty, you’ve been naughty
La-dee da-dee
Move your body


[Cecil Otter]
Or use your body language
A, because it’s easy to read
B, because you’re stuck in anxious-ville
C, you don’t speak easily
Yeah, we can be mind-fuck buddies
Or the beast with two backpacks
You just got to trust somebody
After you suck somebody into your laugh track
Your audience is crying
And I know you’ve noticed
You’re focusing in circles dear
I see your lips moving, but all I hear is
""Does he still love me?
Why don’t he know that I’m in pain?
Why don’t he still need me?
Why don’t he know that I can change?""

[P.O.S]
Take steps like I don’t wanna wake ya
Not a sound from the floorboard, four more steps to the door
Don’t look back don’t get shook, don’t crack
Don’t act so took
Don’t tack another sorry on
Time is gone for that, just go
Maybe cause the time was wrong
Up in the head but the heart’s a strong one
That’s what I shoulda said
Woulda coulda but the door still creaks
Just leave, please just don’t speak
These dreams need sleep
And I woke to a need to relieve not cope
Hope don’t float
Hope sinks low
Hope breeds free with the demons below
Faith is a razorblade you can raise to the face
Of any hangman that gives you the rope
Just go

Lock, stock
Coming for their livestock
Running for they lives
X2
What?

Metal the metal
The medals of honor pierce his chest
Kettle the kettle;
Man, his heart is black and bleeds for the death
To all the rebels
Living off the laws that fear suggests:
He appears a mess
But there's a message he's decoding
And he's the envy of the unknowing
All willing to picture it all perfect
He talks into this mic with nothing in mind
The image is all worth it
No worship in his blood
No curses worth believing in
He's up and he's leaving a love for no reason. And
He's making his rounds
He pounds his chest and hits the streets
He's bad to the bone with bad bones
But he won't admit defeat
Visits the meek;
Who inherently speak
From a well-oiled machine of a heart that won't back off
Comes from a backlog of lost and tough luck
He's completely punch-drunk
But to exhausted to touch love. Breath
He's kept tucked away with that new fame-proof innocence
That's underage, and over paid-attention to
And since he's destined to live without her destiny to rest into:
He'll just search for recipies from injuries to exit wounds
Sets the moonshine down
Writes another victim's tune
And washes the blood from his hands with drinks until his fingers prune


Chorus X2

Verse 2

Never had faith in god
Only trusts the custody he seeks
And he'd just love to have you judge him by the company he keeps
The company of wolves
Customized and cunning
Up-up and running wild in the streets
Running! Running!
He's cutting it close
He's luxury-class
He's up in the smoke and ash of habits
And they broke him fast
He's crashed
Don't cross him
He's wild in the sorrow
But he manages his emotions and lights another Marlboro

Misdemeaner charges for an alledged altercation with a hotel employee
She was arrested and released on a thousand dollar bond but if found
Guilty of the charge, she could face up to sixty days in prison.""

""Gun fire erupted today outside a Greenwich Village radio station. The
Gunplay allegedly stems from an ungoing feud... both artists claim no
Involvement in the incident. No arrests have yet been made in
Connection with the shooting.""

""In other news, rap artist Foxy Brown was hospitalized yesterday after
An apparent overdose on a common prescription drug. While the overdose
Was allegedly an atempt at her own life, no one from the hospital nor
Foxy's family were available for comment. Stay tuned for more news""

""Inga Marchand, also known as rapper Foxy Brown, was taken to a local
Hospital today, when the Range Rover she was driving spun out of
Control at a Brooklyn sidestreet. Although she was not seriously
Injured, Marchand was later arrested for driving with a suspended
Liscense. This is just another in a long list of offences that have
Plagued this Brooklyn rap star.""

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
The sound was broken, too many years being political
Its kinda hard to do when everything your seeing is critical
Is all my fault what they said in the news
But its funny how the public seems to get it confused
They act like they ain't got nothin better to do
All they want is a statement, the hattin' is blatant
But we never paid attention to those who hate us
Til my face was on the cover of all the local papers
But still un-phased, I kept my cool
Plottin, carefully, every step I choose
Am I, cool wit Pone, am I ridin' for Norey
Everybody wanna know my side of the story
Well here it is, the whole truth, plain and simple
This'll finally explain all the pain I've been through
And in no way shape or form am I provoken violence
Please try to understand my ""Broken Silence""

Life Of An Outlaw,2Pac,"62 ContributorsLife of an Outlaw Lyrics[Chorus: Outlawz]
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Why explain the game?
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions if victims can't stand the heat, then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean, itchin'
Givin' suckers plenty space, have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The Feds trail me in hopes that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope, they backwards make the track burst
Whenever I rap, attack
Words been known to explode on contact
Extreme at times, blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me, truly effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice, got a death wish, bitch
Run, but face being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back
Explode the track to confetti
Unload it, 'cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw


[Chorus: Outlawz]
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Code 3: attack formation, pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin' to get you
Merciless madman, screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire, makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'?
Indeed a possibility that's part of chasin' cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives, come closer exhale the fumes
We got memories, fadin' fast
A slave for cash accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now! How you like it, raw?
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the Outlawz
Never surrender, death before dishonor, stay free
I'm thugged out, fuck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin' believe in me
And you could see the victory, a warrior in jewels, will you picture me?
Life of an outlaw


[Chorus: Outlawz]
In the life we live as thugs (No doubt)
Everybody fuckin' with us (Yes!), so can't you see (Life of an outlaw)
It's hard to be a man (Soldiers in position, attack formation)
Ridin' with my guns in hand
(No retreat, no surrender)

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
City under siege, it's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves G.E.D. from the streets
Plenty beef I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb peep! They sneak up from behind tryin' to creep
No halfs with no straps, jack, it's on to bounce back
An ounce of wrath so bad, it snatched my style on death
Tell the gripper I was sent to get ya, snip with clippers
Get the picture, I wrote my life down as a scripture

[Verse 4: E.D.I. Mean]
And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely where ain't nobody holy
A matter of a fact, we unholy Everybody livin' soley
For themselves, too high strung to lend help
To somebody who be needin' it
You know we lost hope and he needin' it
But the evil it's forever
But I'm rappin' low down, scandalous like a tramp is
All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit 6 months in advanced to what we plotted
Approached the goal on swole and now I got it


[Verse 5: Kastro]
Uh, I crack my window, knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow, hand to hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into the mornin'
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'
And let my clout speak for itself
No doubt, outlaw, outta my mind outta time you're all blind
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, 'cause it is perhaps
Finally I'll adapt to it, over the years as an outlaw

[Bridge: 2Pac & Napoleon]
Ayy Napoleon
What's up, nigga?
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me, nigga?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ayy, yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out

[Verse 6: Napolean]
Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites
Snakes are all alike, thug life break night
Drink 'til we fist fight, life or death
But you can't win with a vest
Won't be no breathin' for the reason, punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark, and I admit it's dark
So chase on the ave., hide your stash, beware from them marks
Ayy yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly
And let me bust back to them niggas 'til they all cold and sweaty

Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man

I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip frontin', stuntin', it's something you want
745, chrome spinners, haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot, you know I ain't stoppin'
'Til my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What, nigga? Lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me

Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me

I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man living a lie
I gotta get that money, I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas 'cause they funny
Twenty years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer, 'cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion, I ain't lyin'
Bounty hunters got me flying with my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder, Hennessy and soda
Hood on my shoulder, look in the mirror, I see a soldier

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me

Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me

This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears (What else?)
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy (What else?)
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (C'mon)
Like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers (C'mon)
There's no way I'ma back down like a goddamn coward, I can't
How would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, woah, yo, ho
Hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you (C'mon)
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause

And wait for me on the bench when I run a game of basketball
One squeeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (Why?)
'Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome
He even got closet space inside my home
He ain't never been broke, he glitchless
He's so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam and a scope for distance
The best company when approaching business
He gon' ride with me 'til the end
We all got a friend and mine is a G-U-N

Last time he did the cops had the block all locked off
Take him with me to hustle, stashed him in a trashcan
My fingertips soft, for 4 hours I bag grams
You meet him, your destination's hell or heaven
'Cause I only bring him out for that 187
He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells
He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells
Ms. Jones stay on the 3rd floor, she called the cops on me
They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homie
Niggas know I got new friends so they stay in their place, kid
I stay screaming on niggas and beating up base heads
These niggas ain't thorough, they just like to pretend
Keep fucking 'round they gon' say hello to my little friend

We been through it all but yet we both still living
We been in a box but we both still spitting
And when there was beef, you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen 'til they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know that we was ready for war
Bet the nigga wish he never stuck his head out the door
See whenever you come out, something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stopped rapping like Pac
People see you and run, and you ain't even say shit
They just know you ain't nothing to play with
You stay with sixteen homies, and one in the hole
When the first one get out, the next one go
To know where you headed, you gotta know where you been
The Glock stay with me, we friends 'til the end


[Chorus: 50 Cent]

Wherever I go, he go

You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window

Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me

Hey... hey, whassup?
My name is Dre
Can I blaze some chronic witchu?
(Nigga, what? Fo' sho'!
Roll that shit up!)
Hell yeah

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Still always into something, heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascos—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not Kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it, in most interviews, I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangos, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write ""Dre's light in the ass"" (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air
That means we takin' over this year, you hear?


[Bridge: Girl, KRS-One sample & Dr. Dre]
Chronic, 2000
""One!""
That means we takin' over this year, ya hear?

[Chorus: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]
Light speed, blazin' chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate Thai weed
Or we might be sippin' on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas?

[Verse 2: Hittman]
I hang among hustlers, I slang and hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
'Cause gangbangin' is the active activity
Where I be livin', B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you slippin'
Without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas taken out like chores
I meet whores on tours
Jeanie's hot as pepper, so I sip champagne on stormy shores
Be on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools ""Retreat!"" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh, yeah, I scream on stars
That get loot then crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
""Get out your car, son"" – that's how I came to bougie niggas at Bar One
It's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sardo Numspay
But God's my bulletproof, it's hard to shoot me, you hear?
By the time you see him – {*two gun shots*}
That means it's real fuckin' hard to shoot me, you hear?


[Chorus: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]

General, I salute you
I put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you
It ain't nuttin' cause loyalty's what I'm used to
And what I don't do I have one of my troops do
Nigga we'll kill you

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm ready for combat, a soldier on the front line
Take it to the streets, nigga, motherfuck a punchline (C'mon!)
It only take one time for you to send a death threat
And watch these bullets have that ass singin' like Keith Sweat (Braaattttt)
You ain't met me yet, I been camouflaged in the bushes
And I'm co-signin' 50 'cause them niggas all pussy
Bustin' shots at ya convoy, you don't want war
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam, boy (C'mon!)
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean (Yeah!)
Take cover, we comin' pullin' pins out of grenades
You won't make it to the General without gettin' sprayed (Bitch!)
Might as well say hello to my brand new little friend
Only time he come out to put holes in grown men (Come on)
You can send your troops and get 'em all blow back
Walk up on 'em with a deuce deuce and nigga hold that, Buck

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]

'Cause I won't hesitate to let the chrome touch ya
Nigga, I'm never scared like Bone Crusher
Stand alone, provide my own supper
Tell ya baby momma stop comin' around here or I'm gon' fuck her
Don't try to take up for them lames around you
He'll get shots for free like I flagrant fouled you
I'm on the road blowin' grade A haze and brown (Uh huh)
Got niggas runnin' like the KKK's around (Yea!)
My album's comin', a new year's approachin'
My buzz gettin' bigger, a few ears is open
Can your team play in the game, without you there to coach 'em?
There's a very fine line between a pool and a ocean
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where they Bankhead bounce
And you could come, but after you give Banks head, bounce (Bounce)
These niggas really want war, 'cause if so put on your vest
'Cause all you gotta do is say yes

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
General, I salute you
I put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you
It ain't nuttin' cause loyalty's what I'm used to
And what I don't do I have one of my troops do

And what I don't do I have one of my troops do

The Cross,Nas,"76 ContributorsThe Cross Lyrics[Intro]
Braveheart...

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 1]
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS – N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim, not silently
Noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that Pop shit, it's hard to see
R&B rappers, arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated, say they love me, lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah, I support him, but he's blinded, I see
Jealousy, he love me to death — am I'm buggin'?
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mothers' life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path


[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary would've an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 2]
I can't keep a bitch, 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty maids, watering flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals, plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the smile, you see a nigga who know –
Out of three women, two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin' – ho, get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved, but they fake
Hope y'all relate


[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses

Now tell me what'cha gonna do (Now tell me what...) When there ain't no where to hide
When judgment comes for you (Cause it's gonna come for you)

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Now feel it, the pain was gettin' me hypеd and so violent
But Wally was the worst of us all
Pump in his chest and hе never knew it
Poor Wally had to fall victim, a casualty
But I lay my soul down and I think it all better when it falls down
Everybody got problems to face to face everyday
With it when there's so many lost souls (Lost souls)

[Layzie Bone]
God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven follow the Lord all 24
7 days, God is who we praise even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keepin' me safe and in my place, say grace
And maybe you people should do to the same (The game)
Recognize a good game man, it's an everyday thang how we gotta maintain

[Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me roll stroll whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone on their rest;
Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creepin' up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lasting?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away


[Wish Bone]
Little Eazy's long gone, really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye, all a little thug could do was cry, cry
Why they kill my dog? Damn man, I miss my Uncle Charles ya'll
And he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong (Ooh wrong, ooh wrong...)

[Bizzy Bone]
We choose the way you gonna go into the coffin man
When it comes to Judgement Day
Flame and blaze, and up at The Door
With all of my problems man
What a thankful day
Through the pain I still maintain
Bang! Put it on my grave

When I hit the hater hater, where will I go? This world has been so cruel
And runnin' up when they're hittin 'em strong, Bone

You always got love from Bone
Eternally, gotta love Little E for lovin' me and my peoples B.O.N.E
Yeah, you put that Bone Thugs on now

What's up with murder yall? See my little cousin was hung, somebody was really wrong
Everybody want to test us dog
And Miss Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know we be sinnin' and Krayzie intended on endin' it when it ends
Murder come again, again and again
Now tell me whatcha gonna do?

[Layzie Bone]
And now that they see that the world goes round and round and round
Now I'm startin' to see why somedays I was lonely
But it ain't that the world don't love me
But it's like that when I gotta make the money
Faithful, livin' in a hateful world, it's all about our family and how we grow
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives til eternal our soul


[Flesh-N-Bone]
Yeah, and here we roll, cold, with the Thug N Harmony

Set 'em up with the murder

Soon to take him head on and he's drunk

So get up, get a move on and get your groove on

In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real enables me to make another mill,
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet

With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick

A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
""Cash Rule Everything Around Me""
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?


[Break: Puff Daddy]
We forgive you, for you know not what you do

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
7 a.m. woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No-Doz so pop a couple of those
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, make it gleam
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam
In between the scenes, destroy your dreams
You willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue of a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better get ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open the last seal for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!


[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
For the pump now Leatherface, sin runnin' thuggin' and cuttin'
Little Mo Hart want to pull it ain't nothin'
Bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guns that’s fucked up
Now let me get down for the grind
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get down for the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, ""Give me back me money!""
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass
Now I pull out the cellular phone to call Bone, ""What's happenin'?""
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day

You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin', dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written in kitten, hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve, embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd, man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy
And alleys are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy, really!
So here we go, now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me... flow
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers
Bitchin' over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off!
Before you even started, so what? So long, see you, fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it?
Try boom-bye-bye, bye-bye!

[Chorus: Treach]
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow


[Verse 2: Treach]
The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know where's the wetter flow that's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews, partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in boo boo's, I thought you knew too
Stone style's of stamina, jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party amateur damagers
Managin', damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again, now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebraes
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show, you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time to slang
Bang and watch all the poo-tang tangs hang

[Chorus: Treach]
Here we go, now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 3: Treach]
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass-lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party?
It's 'nuff poo-tang tang for everybody!
So hip up and split up, get up, get up your with up
Souped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not, zip up your lip up
Whip up hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the '70s, find me
So we went crazy in the '80s
So we won't kiss heinies in the '90s
Oops, the Naughty's, troops in sections with forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty


[Chorus: Treach]
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go

Come and feel me flow

Street Dreams,Nas,"134 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийStreet Dreams Lyrics[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Intro]
Uh, what, what, uh

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what a nigga gotta do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings? (What, uh)


[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein' alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich
But now, I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin' on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while I'm hoppin' in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond (Uh), son (What), I had that bitch down on my shit  (What, uh) like this (Word)


[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out
(Uh, what, what, uh)


[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

Creep on in, on in, on in
Woah
See, I'm ridin' high, woah
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got is five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like the cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi (Shinobi)
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
'Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb, da-dumb-dumb
I come to school (Nyoom) with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the dick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin' pains than Maggie
'Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull & Michael Marshall]
I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (Hahahaha)
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell, no! You better bring your own spliff, chief (Five on it)
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my PO
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

My yester-night thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashishs
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low-budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk, Ibeen smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (What's up?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)


[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.​
Today was a good day (Shit)

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun (Yeah)
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out (Uh)
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK

""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes


[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me


[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?


[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Role Model,Eminem,"294 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийPolskiTürkçePortuguêsRole Model Lyrics[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?


[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it


[Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because these


[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

Alright, okay, alright
Baby, yeah, give me that mic, man
Okay, dawg, give—come on, man! Dude!
Give me this mic! Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay & Kon Artis]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And nah, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back


[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis & Eminem]
Look at Em, little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Ayy, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo, Em! You got somethin' to say?! Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up, and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever! I swear, man!

These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold-out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo, wh—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get ninety, and we only get ten percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?


[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem, Bizarre, Bizarre & Eminem]
Girl, why can't you (Roxanne, Roxanne)
See you're the (Bizarre will be your man)
Only one for me?
And it just
Tears my ass apart
To know that
You don't know my
Name! Man, fuck this

[Chorus: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
'Cause once I blow, I know that
I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new slim...

Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton (Compton)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves (Oooohh)
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (Whoops!)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (Ah!)
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryna rap again (Oooohh)
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!

Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke; dumbass, sit down! (Oh)

You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (Eeeh-ww!)

Still, still doin' that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still


[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Still takin' my time to perfect the beat

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E.


[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner wit' your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laidback in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)


[Chorus: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs

Fast Lane,Bad Meets Evil,"256 ContributorsFast Lane Lyrics[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
Uh, first verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice Ice Baby""
Screaming, ""Shady 'til I die!""
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's ""back"" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‘Cause I wanna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this—


[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Ayy)
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank (Oh)
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now (Yeah)
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride (Yeah)

Uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins (Woo)
I made a pact with the devil that says
""I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"" (C'mon)
Go back and forthin', more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now, the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity now
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Was called M&M, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up, and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9"" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it


[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"" & Eminem]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
That these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes (What?)
Girl, I'm the crack-a-lator, percolator of this party
Be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollin' with a player

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus: LV]
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is goin', I don't know

Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

That was Tha Dogg Pound here right on WBallz

You're tuned in to the biggest balls of them all, DJ Sal T. Nuts
Ayy, don't forget about my homeboy Eazy Dick and The Jackoff Hour
That's happening at twelve o'clock tonight
Right now we got some new Snoop Doggy Dogg for that ass
This one is called ""Tha Shiznit""
You're about to go downtown, bitch
Right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
That's 187.4 on your FM dial

Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit and I think it well
How can I makes my grip?
And how should I make that nigga straight slip?
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on a
'Nother mission, wishin' upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the coupe
I used to sell loop, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre

And let me get into some fly gangster shit

You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say?
Gotta take a trip to the M-I-A
And serve your ass with the motherfuckin' AK

So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug

Sack of the chronic in my back pocket low
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday

Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Give me the microphone and let me hit you with a blast

And bitches who fuck him give me the ass

And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' 'bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic

Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn, I see demons
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better
How long will I live? Eternal life and forever
And will I be the G that I was?
I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control

For me to walk again and talk again, but anyway
I get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
Just remember who changed your mind
'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine
Indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want more
'Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (Check it out)

Mad dogging niggas 'cause I don't care

They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war
Pops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next

And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two

[Bridge: Dr. Dre]
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G, so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo
So now you know

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & The Kay-Gees]
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?

Regulate,Warren G,"167 ContributorsRegulate Lyrics[Intro]
Regulators
We regulate any stealin' of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean
Earn your keep
Regulators, mount up

[Verse 1: Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission, tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Verse 3: Warren G]
So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said, ""I'm stuck""


[Verse 4: Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard, they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckers all in his mix

[Verse 5: Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said, ""Damn, what's next?""

[Verse 6: Nate Dogg]
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Verse 7: Warren G]
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings, I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

[Verse 8: Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate


[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 9: Nate Dogg]
I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

[Verse 10: Warren G]
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up, back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

[Verse 11: Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot, in need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell, I said, ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice, would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 12: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare you
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm


[Verse 12: Nate Dogg]
If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day
And if your ass is a buster, 213 will regulate",Lodi Dodi,Snoop Dogg

I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound, watch me act bugged and tear it down

Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan roll with like forty macs
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense

Gun to his neck now, react what?

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp

Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me, who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism, make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' 'caine? I'm givin' out a deadly game

Slip up and get fucked like Suzette

For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resignin', now master

Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals

Be on you like a house on fire—smoke ya
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway
Be like, ""Warriors, come out and play!""
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once—but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizzy-funky for ya
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style

And get funk like a shoe

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit, t here's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya


[Verse 2: Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me


[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah (Haha), and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

But they can't do nothin' to a G

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go), give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G


[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

Woah-ho-ho, let me, like, slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target

So I'll take your ass out quick

If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep

Who's there? Another motherfucking hard rock

A game of chess is like a swordfight
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible

Raw, I'ma give it to ya with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with 'nough niggas and 'nough guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an eighteen-wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan, and yo, the Land Cruiser's out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TECs, nickel-plated MACs, black Acs
Drug-dealin' styles with phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I gots to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now who kill niggas' father

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?

Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shit, boom
Just warmin' up a little bit, ah-eh-em
Rappin'-in' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stackin'-in', hands clappin'-in'
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
Dun-dun-dun, enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff, huff, puff
I'm gonna catch your bluff, tuff, rough
Kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, m-m-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Pretendin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot RZA
Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


[Chorus: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Speakin' of the Devil, psych
No, it's the God, get your shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again, and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad rough task
When I struck, I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your eight-plus-one, start flippin' and trippin'
Niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son

[Interlude: All]
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang (Toad style is immensely strong)


[Verse 6: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist, hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender

[Chorus: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat

Why?
Because, yo, I never, ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?

Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (The Inspectah Deck)

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic' like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier
The hellraiser, raisin' Hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So, uh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the **** that I'm kickin'
The lone ranger
Code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art
To rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin', ""Goodbye,"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck
Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel
I make more noise than heavy metal


[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, yo, flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh'

[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short, Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left
Uh, and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like fame, my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over like they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a, ""Soo?""
'Nough respect due to the 1-6-ooh
I mean, ""Oh""
Yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson
Or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical bud make me—


[Bridge: U-God]
Ooh
What? Grab my nut, get screwed
Ow
Here comes my Shaolin style
True
B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the, ""Soo""

Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Yo, you best protect your neck)

[Verse 4: Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first, man, you're **** with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a **** nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat, rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down, now **** is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin', Ason Unique
Rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your **** ass


[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with **** in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is
You're **** with pros
And there it goes

[Verse 6: RZA]
Yo, chill with the feedback, Black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the **** your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buckest
Style, the ruckus
Ten-times-ten, men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your **** chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
He'll be comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My Clan increase like Black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare
Ge-Gecka-Genius, take us the **** out of here

[Verse 7: GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these cold killer labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now, that thought is just as bright as a twenty-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy, they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Huh, huh
Huh

He looks determined without being ruthless
Something heroic in his manner
There's a courage about him, doesn't look like a killer
Comes across so calm
Acts like he has a dream
Full of passion
You don't trust me, huh?
Well, you know why
I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway
[Intro]
Knock niggas out the box all the time
Niggas know my motherfuckin' repertoire, big ones (Uh-huh)
(Yeah, motherfucker, straight up)
(I'll fuck your whole team up) Take care of B.I., Chef
(Yeah, bust it, yo, yo) Fly G.I. niggas

[Chorus]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces
[Verse 1]
Thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass-heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hours, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, word life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it
Real niggas lick shots, peace Connecticut

[Verse 2]
Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable
Real niggas raise up, spend your money, argue
But this time is for the uninvited
Go 'head and rhyme to it, bitch nigga, mics is getting fired
More fiends, chicks be burning like chlorine
Niggas recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moët be tasting like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death, whips rolled up
You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with MAC-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son?
Do you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I'll probably wax tracks, smack rap niggas, you, facts
Niggas' lyrics are wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missiles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimum wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac'
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French, but let me speak Italian
Black stallions wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan


[Chorus]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

[Verse 3]
I do this for barber shop niggas in the Plaza
Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like fuck, waving they arms to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlúas on rocks
On the crack spots, rubber band wrap all my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the feds
Word up, cousin, nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto

Basically
Can't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze


[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real, yeah, uh

[Interlude: Booster & Method Man]
When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
When I will be di number one (Tical)
And now yuh listen to di Gorgon (Gorgon)
And a Gorgon sound a Rein
An' any jump and come tes' mi (Test me)
Mi a-go lick out dem brain (it’s like that)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll


[Interlude: Method Man]
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (Motherfucker, I'll fuckin')
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

[Outro: Method Man]
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off and feed you nothin' but sleepin' pills
Get yours, motherfucker

Liquid Swords,GZA/Genius,"148 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiLiquid Swords Lyrics[Skit: Gibran Evans]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of 131 lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
(*Woman screaming*)
That was the night everything changed

[Intro: RZA]
See, sometimes
You gotta flash 'em back
See, niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin', we gonna take y'all back to the source
Through knowledge, yo
[Chorus: GZA & RZA]
When the MCs came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now gone off the mental plane, to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut


[Verse 1: GZA]
Fake niggas get flipped in mic fights
I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene
Like a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
But it was your op. to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my ""Clan in da Front"" want it

[Chorus: GZA & RZA]
Now, when the MC's came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now born with the mental plane to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, the RZA flip the track with the what to cut


[Verse 2: GZA & RZA]
I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords, they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
'Cause niggas' styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two-to-four
'Round the clock get that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be stickin' with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells (When the MC's)
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep, it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

My specialty from me to you is MC
Say what you wanna say, baby, say
I flip the microphone any day
I'm mad swift because I got that gift of gab
Niggas get mad, your ass never had
This talent that I got will rizzock the spot

Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""boom-boom"" and your guns go ""pow-pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques, I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is born, I leave mics torn when I put it on

Got more cash than Gotti (You don't know?), you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed, to tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair, Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L, you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My raps is steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn

[Intro: Method Man]
Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming
[Chorus: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up (The ice cream man is coming)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, honey dip, summertime fine, Jheri dripping
Seen you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're cliquing
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a freshwater scrod, or may I not be God?
Attitude is very rude, boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love, hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right, true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me, hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
Goddamn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered, put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo, pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
But, uh, back to you, Maybelline queen, let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except C.R.E.A.M
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

Yo, I'm lounging big dick style, y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making, too fly, jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good, fly-colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black?
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square, dear
You better have cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui, yeah

Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like thunder
Politic to your deficit step, give me your number
Your sexy persuasive tatas and thighs
Catch my eyes like pies, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time
Ice cream, you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh, baby, I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind-state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me?
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby, shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you wanna get dug like the pockets
I jizz 'em like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets

Keep your nails done and your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter pecan Ricans for calling me papi

College Park in the house
Decatur
Uh, Old National got the skanks
Everybody, uh, know what I'm sayin'
Check it

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
""Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit""
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
Is that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving a shoutout to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison


[Chorus: OutKast]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of its skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate us 'cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

[Chorus: OutKast]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit

And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""


[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at The Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife be making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when He starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

[Chorus: OutKast]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""
Now throw your hands in the air

Ayo, Dram, this the first
This the first time you had a nigga from Brooklyn

And I-I-I-I just wanna
I-I just wanna say thank you, man
For taking Brooklyn down by them, you know what I'm sayin'?
Lettin' niggas see what's going on, man
I know niggas heard a lot about Brooklyn
They heard about B.I.G; they heard about Jay
But Brooklyn still coming, nigga, we still coming
There's a lot of niggas, you know what I mean?

Welcome To Real Life,Joe Budden,"7 ContributorsWelcome To Real Life Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Yo, I seen shorty on the staircase, in front of an empty beer case
Weird face, almost like he was scared straight
Like he ain't have a care in life (uh), wipin' tears from his eyes
That already appeared to have been dried
We chopped it, said he was adopted
And there's a lot of shit he just tucks in his closet (uh)
Real calm, said he'd always feel harm
And all he want to do is meet his real dad and real mom
All the nice home and clothes do is remind me (how when)
In all these years, they ain't even tried to find me
Never mind love, I feel like they never liked me
If I thought there was a God, I would ask the nigga ""why me?""
But some things you better off havin' never knew
Maybe they wanted better for you than they could ever do
You got a family, I see that you don't care for them
But love gon' always be love, no matter where it's from
What if I said your moms couldn't give birth
Contemplated leavin' Earth, 'til you brought her life worth
Whatever you goin through, could always be much worse
Don't make a mistake, mistakin' your blessings for a curse (so)
So, told dude you in the right place, right here
Can't run to your corner when life don't wanna fight fair (talk to 'em)
Things'll become quite clear
When you decide to wake up and stop havin' fantasies about a nightmare (oh!), yeah


[Chorus: Emanny (Joe Budden)]
They don't see, who you are
They too busy posin' (uh)
But the front won't go far
Just thank God your fantasy ain't real (welcome to real life)
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
(Welcome to real life)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Yeah, you damn right she on her high horse
She say ""don't worry 'bout hers nigga, ride yours""
Before you talk, clean your own backyard
Souped up and sought after by the athletes and rap stars (uh)
Developin' a name, creepin to fame
She quick to trade her vagina for a seat at the game
And it's so foul, she don't see the shame
In the act or the fact that she view it as an equal exchange (oh!)
But she stay with the newest on, Louboutins
Buyin' groceries with coupons, sleepin' on a futon
No self-esteem to cover her lack of confidence
She get on Twitter, retweetin' all the compliments
Pretty face, nice strut with a nice butt
Disguise of a slut, only tryin' to get wifed up
But when it's party time, she won't be a second late
Once she leaves V.I.P., it's back home to Section 8
What confused me
Is niggas tried to kick it but she come across bougie, in her best friend's jewelry
Part-time mother (but), but somethin' real shady when her
Two year old daughter much closer to the babysitter (uh)
Cry when she alone, product of a broke down home (yeah)
Won't change 'cause she already grown (talk to 'em)
Already set in her ways, no need in tryin' to help (talk to 'em)
So she'd rather find wealth before she can find herself (oh!), yeah


[Chorus: Emanny]
They don't see, who you are
They too busy posin' (yeah)
But the front won't go far (uh)
Just thank God your fantasy ain't real (welcome to real life)
Fantasy to real life
You got everything (tah) but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life (uh)
You got everything but ain't got nothin' (talk to 'em)

[Break: Emanny (Joe Budden)]
You can be what you want
But it's too much for ya to let go
Ain't got to be somethin' else (uh)
Better off just bein' yourself
Ain't gonna get you far (never)
When you gonna wake up and deal with the real life?
The real life
(Tah, welcome to real life)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Real quick, let me introduce y'all to Maverick
Lifetime addict, who recently kicked the habit (uh)
Lookin' for a job, companies won't let him have it
'Cause there's drug and gun charges up and down his whole jacket (uh)
Constantly rejected, can't deal with the aggravation (so)
So now he scared to be honest on the application
Past caught up, 'cause every door shuts like ""sorry we can't help ya""
Then it's back home to the shelter (oh!)
Nothin' to lose, givin' up like many other minions
Pendin' his trial in the court of public opinion
'Til he got a call from a temp agency
Said they had a void, asked could he fill the vacancy? (okay)
Unlike what he appears, been employee of the month for a year (I guess)
Self doubt is related to fear
And they'll never replace him
If ya gon' catch up with your dreams, gotta be willin' to chase them (oh!), yeah


[Chorus: Emanny]
They don't see, who you are
They just see your posin'
But the front won't go far
You can turn your fantasy to real
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin', nothin', nothin'",Suicide,Fabolous
The Necessary Evils,Skyzoo,"6 ContributorsThe Necessary Evils Lyrics[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
Survival of the fittest, posted where it's probable for pitchin
And suicide doors is the object of the mission
You either outdoors like ""I got it, come and get it""
Or stirrin upstairs with a stop watch in the kitchen
Followin the minute hand
Like ""Lord help us"", good pot, bag full of bottles and a ceiling fan
Good block, ain't nobody similar at all for a minute
So should of get the click until it's gone if you with it
Get it from when it sizzle to it yawn in a scrimmage
Coffee cup early in the morn' with the business
So fuck if you slow, money never waits
And dreams do got wings, they could levitate
Sleep now and you starve later (starve later)
But two seaters turn divas into soft layups (get it?)
Same song, different DJ
It's downloaded if you need it on a replay

[Hook - Skyzoo] - 2X
Call it the necessary evils
I ain't tryin to get by, I'm tryin to speed through
Nah I ain't tryin to get by, I'm tryin to speed through
We tell this corner goodbye as soon as we through
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Fast cars, fast broads
Fast money, it really ain't that hard
But every dollar you make comes with a set of eyes
And a set of loose lips if ever you ever hide
And everything that's should is residin that far
And everything that good is right in your backyard
And everything that kills is typin you back hard
And everything that will depends on the backboard (woo)
But we ""Trill"", somethin like Ross is (Ross is)
Short sleeves in the winter for the flossin (flossin)
Twenty degrees on the wrist, no defrostin
Cost two whole weekends, you gon' see this
And you the next contestant
Your life could go from Mickie D's to Benihana's, Tameka to Rihanna
Huh, same song, different DJ
It's downloaded if you need it on a replay

[Break - Skyzoo]
Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
Get it two more times in the same night (same night)
Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
That money buildin and you feelin kind of nice

Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
Get it two more times in the same night (same night)
Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
But you blinked and now you sprintin with blue and whites

For What It's Worth,Skyzoo,"8 ContributorsFor What It’s Worth Lyrics[Intro: 2Pac sample]
It so, basic that we all want to be famous and noticed and watched
And we all want money and riches and want
We all want the finest out of life
From a, from the most heartless gangbanger
To the most ah, virtuous police officer
AND we're all um, human beings
So we're all susceptible to our own weaknesses
Temptation is a very strong weakness

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
There's too much money in cocaine for me to be playin the broke game
Or at the nine to five with the no names
But here I be, nine to fifthin it with all of them no names
Tryin to figure out who I'm gon' blame
For where I be and where I be is nothin that I ever dreamed
Everything I'm turning into was never me
None of this was scripted
Or maybe it was and I was too blind to get this
And maybe because I was too blind to get this
I threw it to the street
But look at me, I'm making up excuses as we speak
See the reality of it is
It's easier to be cold out then bundled in
And he who be on the slow route is running thin
Or so it seems and now I'm treadmilling my life on a lower speed
All that really matters is a profit
Tomorrow I handle the aftermath of how I got it
Fuck all of the worrying and all of the second guessing
I don't got time to deal with a second question
Life is what you make it be and everything in life is shaped to be
I vow to turn it 'round and then bow gracefully
Not enough reasons to say no
And too many reasons to say yes and I ain't pressed to say so
Been dealing with the same dollar and the same dream
Lost between Plans A and B


[Hook: Skyzoo w/ ad libs]
And this is for what it's worth
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
But it feels like time keeps walkin
Time keeps walkin, walkin away from me
Huh, so for what it's worth
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
But it feels like time keeps talkin
Time keeps talkin and I don't understand what it say

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
There's too much money in heroin for me to pretend to be negligent
I'm ignorin it more than I ever did
And I can't lie, they say all it take is time to better it
But my clock is lookin foreverish
Like why can't I, be blessed with a more blessed set of wings
I see less as more or less everything
More or less everything that I ever wanted is all gone
And replaced with what I've been runnin from all along
So why even entertain the chase?
Why even pretend I was built to stay in this race?
The truth is my sweetest dream
Is so far from my hands that I don't even reach
I'm so far from a plan that right now, anything'll do
Cause if the lullabies that the corner sing is true
Then hit the play button and I'll be down until it's gone
All the hopes that use to be become the sounds within the songs
And with that said, I say ""Good Morning America""
Say it once more just in case it wasn't clear enough
""Good Morning America"", this is what your dreams are made from
As well as what your dreams could break from
Ignorin all the risks, all the cops, all the enemies
All the nameless bullets that could be namelessly sent to me
All the fame from pullin it and all of the fame
From bein on the wrong side, which one do you claim?

I'm just tryin to make what I can make
But it feels like time keeps talkin
Time keeps talkin and I don't understand what it say

[Verse 3 - Skyzoo]
Turned down every offer I was given
Regardless of the wrath or the temp, I'm pivot
And I'm just tryin to keep it straight and narrow
But I'm seein Satan's arrow and it's hard not to get hit with it
I'm duckin low and prayin that it all pays at the finish line
And that I don't have to pay for it when it's dinner time
But bein honest, left never looked so right
And that corner never looked so bright
The outcome ain't worth tryin not to be not outdone
Outrun what you can but where you run out from'll
Always be your home base
Until you lookin back home with a stone face
All the shit that you fall for is twinge with your dreams, all gone
You question if your questions were all wrong
You seein how it changed, each side of the game
Cause your pink slips is they bullets, neither got a name, damn

With a platinum plaque, it's like Robbin, George, and Jack
The mind fears what the blinds hide but I'm here on the blind side
Hanging up 'til the line dies then off the hook for the crimes tried
Get awful looks from tribe tribe, unlawful jux when you climb skies
That's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal
In Hollywood and featherweight, I step by step, let it escalate
'Til you get it, will tell you if I hit it
We can make pie if we don't fidget

[Verse 2]
Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen
And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles, wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel, 'til it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity

[Verse 3]
The applause of patrons at the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you can never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feeling your pain
I was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?


[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Man, I really miss my pops
Hope that God watches over him and that he's on top
That there is no more disease and that he's alright
That he's one of the generals inside the army of the light
And grandma, you know I had to bite something from you
So after every show it's ""peace, and much love to you""
Auntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl
I know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners
Turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go
Holy apartments in the gardens in which the rivers flow
Thank you for all your blessings and all of your miracles
I thank all my fans and all my supporters
Shout out to Bishop G, congrats on your new baby daughter
I tip my hat to all my family and friends
Now we just got one more to go, L-U-P-END


[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

Rule,Nas,"79 ContributorsRule Lyrics[Intro: Nas]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Nas, uh
Yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Nas]
I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time, it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? We must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children


[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""Dog you safe whenever you with me, see, this is my town""
So the youngsters grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At a early age already know what's against him
So in order for him to survive
One day he must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rise
'Cause everybody wants a shot
In this land of opportunity, look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet?
The Earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks, and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo


[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World

[Verse 3: Nas]
Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip-hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now


[Outro: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Outro: Skit]
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing, man
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, man, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is, like
Whatever you want out of life, whatever you feel is rightfully yours
Go out and take it, even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about
This is— This is what my country is

You got yourself a gun (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines, so
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

[Verse 1: Nas]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody

I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a
Barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's
Return of the golden child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)

But I worry about you
I worry about you all the time
Hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold onto that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, 'cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)

He went from ashy to classy — haha, I like that (Alright, alright)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I see ya later
Here comes the drama
""Oh, that's that nigga with the fake""
Blaow! ""Why you punch me in my face?"" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies — butter crunch

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off and global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on Gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand""

I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know
[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smokin' weed in the street without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruisin' blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Troopin' outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin' fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin' dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon, Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', clique rollin'
Trickin' six-digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa, Africa


[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Nas]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the Gat with the cocked hammer
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it
Sky's the limit, I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!


[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Nas]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Nas]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled
I'd free all my sons (Diamonds) (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world

Yeah, fuck you
Fuck you too
Fuck you bitch
Fuck you motherfucker
You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
Yeah, whatever whatever
Whatever
You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin' my dick
You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin' my pussy
You nasty bitch
You a nasty motherfucker
Check it, uhh
(Crab ass nigga)

[Refrain 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (Another bitch), in my life

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked another nigga dick, y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six, y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trial
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' 'bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fuckin' tonight, knahmean?!
(I'm fuckin' you toniiight..) feel me? Uhh


[Refrain 2: Lil' Kim]
What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
'Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage?
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hang like plaques on the wall in your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep
We've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', ""Kim you need to leave him!""
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But, see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one, pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop—there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So ""click it or ticket,"" let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag

Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass?

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well, I was looking at them, there, there, on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too—no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail – on the low, ho

I like the way you move

I love the way you move

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop me
Come on, lady, dance all around me
You (Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me (Out of my) out of my mind
(Out my mind) Ooh, baby, if I could
I would just leave with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me, baby, ooh!

California love

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a


[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!


[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A

Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house

And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside
'Cause you and I know it's the best side

She's feeding fools' fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G-Man and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear, saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit the track, catch a date, and come pay the kid

I Got 5 On It,Luniz,"137 ContributorsI Got 5 On It Lyrics[Intro: Michael Marshall]
Creep on in, on in, on in
Woah
See, I'm ridin' high, woah
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got is five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like the cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi (Shinobi)
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
'Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb, da-dumb-dumb
I come to school (Nyoom) with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the dick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin' pains than Maggie
'Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull & Michael Marshall]
I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (Hahahaha)
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell, no! You better bring your own spliff, chief (Five on it)
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my PO
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me


[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull & Yukmouth]
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashishs
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low-budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk, Ibeen smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja (Wouh)
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do, kick in feed
'Cause where I be, we needs half like Umfufu


[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back

This Is Why I'm Hot,MIMS,"54 ContributorsThis Is Why I’m Hot Lyrics[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply


[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean


[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire


[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I got a chip in my engine, twenty-six-inch rims
I got fade-away money, bitch, I'm ballin' out the gym
Got my old school bumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind (Yeah)
Diamonds on my pinky (Yeah), hand on the pine
Bitch, you touch and die, your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth (Yeah), got some Gucci on my seat
Got G's on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (Mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (Throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain, eighty-four's on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

The name you know of
A little bit of change, now your boy done blown up
In them foreign thangs with the guts exposed
Stuntin' ain't a thing to me
And it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
You need to get like me
Stuntin' is a habit, just gotta have it
Shawty keep throwin' that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life
But if you did your homework, girl
I'm pretty sure you know what I got
Drop top, and you know Jones and Banner gonna roll
Let me stop

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach ('Bach)
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack (Crack)
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin'
Them twenty-eight's on deck (Deck)
Thirty-seven on my wrist, a hundred-five on my neck (Yeah)
This rap money's okay, but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm, but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (Doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes (Toes) and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose (The nose), the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But Black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (Uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Peeps call me up [phone ring] said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: ""wassup?""
I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing ""Right Thurr"" - he glistening""
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gonna hit, aww shit

Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on your nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, with a bowl of Tender Vittles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm with Chingy, at the Holiday Inn

I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
Ayy, holla if you like your beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, and your top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back

I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 1]
I'm the man in my city, ain't nobody fucking with me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer, I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class with me
SS'S on 26's, watching some television
Shorty, I'm never slipping, got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
In a stolen automobile, the roof and the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me, it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping


[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

On this Glock I clutch, In God I trust
If a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust
Got your partners and the broad in your car fucked up
With ya under estimations, thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts, on this purp I blow
Move 10 bricks daily, trying to twerk 5 mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road
All the fliest, burnin' Cali, fucking Hollywood Ho's
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro, Dro
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow
Hey, nigga don't you hit me 'less you buying 6 or mo
My 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking


[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 3]
I wear the crown down under, man somebody better tell 'em
'Fore I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me, just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck, got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car

[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Ayy, holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black",We Fly High,Jim Jones
Grillz,Nelly,"73 ContributorsGrillz Lyrics[Intro: Jermaine Dupri, Paul Wall, Nelly]
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em, ""Make me a grill""
Uh, uh
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold
Yo
We 'bout to start an epidemic with this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandi Williams]
Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh), in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh), in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I
Open up your mouth, your grill gleamin' (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefin' (Chiefin')
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood, just say


[Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall & *Jermaine Dupri*]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)

What it do, baby? It's the iceman, Paul Wall (Yeah)
I got my mouth lookin' something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them thirty pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on)
My teeth are mind-blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grills

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds (Hey)
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)
You can catch me in my Too $hort drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
Ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These ho's can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Come on)

Why,Jadakiss,"87 ContributorsWhy LyricsJadakiss has a lot of questions, many rhetorical.[Intro: Jadakiss]
Haha! Is that real!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Anthony Hamilton]
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets?
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if they part of your set?
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death?
Yeah, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around, only give you eight months for a burner?
It's goin' down; why they sellin' niggas' CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan
That ain't get that break?
Why you don't stack instead of tryin' to be fly?
Why is rattin' at an all time high? Why are you even alive? (Why?)
Why they kill 2Pac and Chris?
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Cris? (Oh, why?)
Why them bullets have to hit that door?
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw? Why'd he kiss that whore?
Why?! (Good lord, tell me why)

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I’ve been given
It's this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?


[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Why do niggas push pounds and powder?
Why did Bush knock down the towers?
Why you around them cowards?
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight?
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari?
Why he take that bike?
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail?
Why they stop lettin' niggas get degrees in jail?
Why you gotta do 85% of your time?
And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over, why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but be sellin' the least? why

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I’ve been given
It's this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?


[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke
Then why the hell you reachin' for my dutch?!
Why rap? ‘Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a ""Why lie? I need a beer"" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dyin'?
‘Cause they moms at work
They pops is gone, they livin' with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screamin' like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcin' you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?
Why? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow, son
And you know why they made the new twenties?
‘Cause I got all the old ones — that's why!

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?

Never Let Me Down,Kanye West,"263 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaEnglishРусскийPortuguêsKanye West - Never Let Me Down ft. JAY-Z & J. Ivy (Traduzione Italiana)Never Let Me Down LyricsOriginally recorded by Hov for his seventh studio album The Blueprint²: The Gift & The Curse, “Never Let Me Down” finds the track’s inherent hope being interpreted differently by the trio:


Kanye thanks his… Read More [Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh baby
Hahahaha
Turn the motherfuckin' music up
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Over Chorus: Jay-Z]
That's right, it's what I do!
C'mon, uh-huh
Nah, you know I never let you down!
Gyeah, gyeah, yuh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy


[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side


[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church


[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down
[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
Dissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why

My flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year, I was going through hella problems
'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart"", and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
I'm so Chi' that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro

At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now, she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late, mami
Your screen saver say Tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
You mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib (I mean)
That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib (I mean)
You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?

She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high (Yeah), ow

But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well, okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
Her sister the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a OkayPlayer-hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet (No)
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate

Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marks is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a MC with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, MCs retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then

We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying? Come on

The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight

I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you pose taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow

I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars
Well I treat bitches like drinks
When I step in the club and by out tha bar
So let me quench my thirst wit you and a friend
Instead of the juice and gin
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in
Glass full of ass for a true muthafucka
With that that turquoise Coogi on
You remind me of a blue mutha fucka
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada
But I think Gina was hotta
Cause her skin tone was like a Pina colada
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies
So I ordered them a mi tia and hot saki
Then I got cocky
And asked them do they come to this club a lot
Well ya got a brotha hot
Hop in my bubble drop
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita one wit the karma of margarita
The other one like two shots of tequila
And they all fine I really don't know what to think
As I get bubble and choose, I try to figure out

Know not to bring no Cosmopolitan asses
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neapolitan masta
No telling what these thick bitches would do
Reminiscent of a big old pitcher of brew
But hit cha like a slow screw
Dip in a strip a club in LA wit a bankroll
Where the weather ain't cold
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll
I met two dancers named Moet and Crystal
I was checkin they style
We had a session it was wet it was wild
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remy Red
Wit skinny legs
Both of them game to give me head
Wit a little bit Absolut Vodka fo' they homie Tasha
Tell her to come closa
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa
If I was mayor I would campaign ass
Politician wit women swimming around the champagne glass
Drunk so much I might hurl in the sink
And if you ask me why
I couldn't figure out

Look at that big old donkey you toting
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop cup
And have a toast wit King Boo
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck
I holla Church cause its pimps in the party
Let me sip on ya body
Get a good buzz of ya like you Lemon Bacardi
Or a long Island havin' sex on the beach
Or in the Lac sunroof let back wit a tec on the seat
Got a red bone I call her strawberry Daiquiri
Bring her back fo' may
Carry packs fo' may
Had her suck off my faculty
Got a little mamma name Mimi
Who remind me of martini and Asti Spumante
How she move to my CD
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat
She help me shake up dope
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think
As I get bubbly and choose
And try to figure out

The first verse deals with the rapper’s early career as a… Read More [Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch


[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up


[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up

First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? Y'all niggas all fed up 'cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems,"" gotta move carefully
'Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me, oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryna do me
If the record's two mil', I'm just tryna move three
Get a couple chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Yeah)


[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
And then the Fugees gon' break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more?
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground, I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four-pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live?
I told you '96 that I came to take this shit and I did
Handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Niggas, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Holla at me)
Ain't no love (Take 'em to church), in the heart of the city
Uh, uh, uh, uh, my nigga, where is the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Fuck)


[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Then Richard Pryor go and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful, you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Haha, and more baggies, why you all aggy?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit
Where's the love?
Where's the love?

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town

You walkin' round naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settlin' down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin' at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin' that this song's comin' on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin'; you start crying
I come over; I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losin'
I'm a ghost, and you know this

But you don't want the same thing
Hmm, well, two can play that game
So I'm chillin' with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin' from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' 'em if she'd wanna play games
We the Super Smash Brothers, but none of 'em you
I miss the sex where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the art of choking's
Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light

I knew it would be inevitable, that my case should go federal
Its part of my journey, see it might concern me
But who Cam's best friend? My attorney!
Can you hold something, Can I throw you some
Now I know you dumb, Where I know you from
I ain't got it right now, but I owe you one
In your head, one shot from a loaded gun
Don't get extorted, I get escorted
To the resort, where the girls say, ""Lets snort it.""
I can import it, export it sports car
Lets port it, fresh auto, I report I just bought it
I scream lets get it, they ain't pimp my ride
My cars an exhibit, huh? next critic
I don't talk it I just live it, just prove it
Tell the feds Calm down, it's just music

She tried to lock that pussy up, but I came through like bail bonds

Told her to come downstairs, we did it all in my Caddy'
Asked her where them kids is at, she said upstairs with they daddy (WHOOO)
Money coming in by the packs, everyday I pop tags
In the club wasting this cash; bitch, keep bouncing that ass
She said real niggas don't last, they say real niggas don't last
Nah, it's just too many fake niggas making real niggas look bad
Get lost with your lame ass, livin' fast - no brake pads

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Yo, yo I speak pain, I spit power, talk courage, breathe flowers
Follow me through the debris of these towers
The rain, the sleet, the street showers
Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour
The soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together
In the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got the fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up, you know
You already know what I'm about homie
I'm young, I'm focused, I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me (woo!)
No, I ain't stopping yet (yeah)
No, my album ain't done, it ain't dropping yet
I'm in the midst of a bidding war
And we need two mil' more just to move in the door, shit

This shit'll disgust ya
Underground with people, lethal
Trapped in the desert, surrounded by Eagles (Dipset, girl)
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest by Mitchell and Ness (jersey)
Got her open, hoping she's not
I'll have her, crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She get cracked up and hit, keep soap in your sock, mami (mami)
My girls lay up in suites
A half a cake a week, and masturbate like Tweet, Killa
I be popping them Uzis, copping them Coogis
Eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is Snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking her rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that'll merk you like Jayson Williams (uh huh)
Don't play with villains, vacate the building
Or the apes'll come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram
I'm still the man, word to Killa Cam (Killa)

Come holla at us, the boys are back at it

To my head of security, British the Titan, clicking the fifth, and gripping it tight, goddamn it
Not to mention my bishop and knights, soliciting bricks of the white
Making crucial trips through the night (highways)
And Prince Juelz, I told you ever since Juelz
If them faggots even flinch Juelz (bluuuuatttt)
My dogs gonna 'em alive
Forty-four's depleting, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa while he's leading the movement
For realer we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in the tombs, just facing my time
Lawyer on side, outside spoiler on ride
System bumping, bumping Oh Boy in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit
He done came got his boy, it's a shame that his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employ
Which is none other

They gon’ get you a wire, like niggas gon’ use it
You gon’ tell on your brothas, what a lame homie
I got a bullet with your name on it, and a full clip I autographed
Kids cryin’ at the viewing, I guess it was sorta sad

[Chorus]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust


[Verse 2]
Lotta niggas act Tony-like
Told them D's everything you heard but that’s your homie right
But he got killers lurkin’ outside at your home tonight
They gon’ hit the crib and kill the kids, oh that’s Kony right
Oh that’s Kony-like, everybody bleed
Cuz he come out in 2060, Christmas Eve
First time he went to prison he ain’t get to leave
Feds takin’ pictures, niggas is rats, you should say cheese
Once a local dude, shit the fire now
Never ever spit a rap but he got bars now
I’m talkin fed time, yard up, yard down
Baby mama can’t pay the bills, shit is hard now
How that make you feel, you should pay them bills
Inmates spittin in them trays when they make yo’ meal
Niggas shittin’ out them packs just to take them pills
And his baby mama brought em in, boy this shit is real
Niggas turn to Muslim, niggas turn to Christian
They gave him life, he try’n appeal it, got him on a mission
His homies ain’t learn, they still in the kitchen
They firin’ bullshit, that coka ain’t swimmin’
It’s coming up short, no food on the fork
Niggas is catchin’ cases, niggas is goin’ to court
He done slaved in the field, you the one on the porch
With the gun in your hand, try and run with the man


[Chorus]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust

[Interlude]
Hey look, I’ma tell you like this
If you in school nigga, stay in school
If you got a job nigga, stay at work
If you a family man, stay with your muhfuckin’ family nigga
Cuz this shit ain’t meant for everybody dawg
Everybody talk that shit, until they get caught up in some real shit
And then they start talkin’ that shit

[Chorus]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money

[Verse 1]
Stop, chill, relax, and let this nigga Sigel flow
I know you can't believe the flow, you can't cope –
I flow dope, like a key ya blow
You like, ""Nah, Beans? Same nigga from 21st and Sigel street?!""
When it's beef, people let them Desert Eagle speak
So whoever, wherever–I don't care where we meet
Stop, chill, don't talk shit sideways outta your mouth
I will slap spit sideways outta your mouth
Bitch niggas talk indirect, it don't matter
When you got snitch niggas right in your set
That's why I know where you niggas sling coke and pump D at
Same spot that you liable to see me at
Gun and a mask, one in the stash, where the seat at
Stop–all my young bucks huggin' the block
Stop puttin' drugs in your sock
You makin' it easy for the cops to catch you
They hooked to that stash, and that trash, and that bag of pretzels
You gotta hustle smarter than that
Cop coke harder than that, keep your dough apart from your crack
Keep a stash in the dark for the trap
Man, you never know when the narcs gon' launch an attack


[Hook]
Stop – I know you cats livin' a lie
You niggas' rats, you ain't willin' to die
Chill – I spit it for my niggas keepin' it street
Keepin' they steel, all my niggas keepin' it real

Stop – I know you cats livin' a lie
You niggas' rats, you ain't willin' to die
Chill – I spit it for my niggas keepin' it street
Keepin' they steel, all my niggas keepin' it real

[Verse 2]
It's still vets in the game, try'na earn respect
I got the best thug album, and y'all ain't heard shit yet
You can shuffle up the cards, I'ma learn the deck
When I do–the game is mine; man, I'm aimin' high
Niggas talk about guns, don't be carryin' none
Every two hammers I cock, I'm buryin' one
I'ma dress in all stash this year, whenever I'm near
From the First Union, to Madison Square
Stop, chill, 'cause I know y'all niggas like ""Mac fuckin' that track""
Let me show you somethin', dawg – it ain't nothin' for Mac
It come all natural, like I'm bustin' my gat
Or I'm stuck in a spot, crushin' the crack
Got ice in a pot, fluffin' the crack
Takin' backs to the block, so don't stuff in them packs
Doin' life on the Roc, ain't nothin' fuckin' with that
Me – jail? Dawg, you can put me under the ground
Where I'm from, all my niggas, they from under the ground
You can hear us when we come, it's a thunderous sound
Trees, stompin', Roc jeans, and a bunch of white T troopers
Stay on post with they toast, and they like to shoot you
Philly cats no rack, big guns and Sumas


[Hook]
Stop – I know you cats livin' a lie
You niggas' rats, you ain't willin' to die
Chill – I spit it for my niggas keepin' it street
Keepin' they steel, all my niggas keepin' it real

Stop – I know you cats livin' a lie

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
We are at war with the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometime that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

[Verse 2 Robin Thicke]
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no


[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny? (Oh-oh-oh)
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? (What have I done) What am I gonna be?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything? But I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They try tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating (Oh)
And they wonder why black people still voting (Ooh)
'Cause your president still choking (Oh yeah)
Take away the football team, the basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit (Yeah, yeah)
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer (Yeah, yeah)
Let's pray

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
These friends, they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no


[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be? (What am I gonna be?)
What have I done so bad? (Oh) What is my destiny? (What have I done?)
You tie my hands (What have I done?), what am I supposed to see? (What have I done?)
What have I done so bad? (Ooh) What am I gonna be? (Oh, oh)

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne and Robin Thicke]
Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare (Oh)
Yes, I know the process is so much stress (Oh, come on, baby)
But it's the progress that feels the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success, and you're next
So try, they can't steal your pride, it's inside (Oh, woah)
Then find it and keep on grinding (Woah)
'Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know

[Interlude: Lil Wayne and Robin Thicke]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
See, right now we just riding on love, huh
(Take that money, make that money)
A shot in the dark
(Take that money)
We ain't tryin' to do nothing but hit the heart
(I can't wait to stop the wait, all of it)
We need love
(Love, okay)
That's all y'all, that's all


[Chorus: Robin Thicke and Lil Wayne]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
(Yeah, born right here in the USA)
What have I done so bad? (What have I done?) What is my destiny? (What have I done?)
(But, due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee)
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see? (Tie me up)
(So accept my emotion)
What have I done so bad? (Tie me up) What am I gonna be? (Oh, oh-oh)
(Do not take it as an offensive gesture)
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
(It's just the epitome of my soul)
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny? (Oh, baby)
(And I must be me, we got spirit y'all, we got spirit)
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
(We got soul y'all, we got soul)
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

It's where ever you wanna go!

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my two-seater she's the one that I would take, wee

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came

[Verse 3: Drake]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
Twenty-three and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun

CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up

And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'

And I won't work for nobody but you

Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup

But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em

But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone

Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone

Cause she just can't help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
(Do what the hell I want, nigga)
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me but she don’t
(She never do though, haha)
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit
That I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the mornings
I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done
I swear this is all I hear

The Real Her,Drake,"171 ContributorsThe Real Her Lyrics[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down

You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, ""That ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
""Someone Like You,"" more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies",Mrs. Officer,Lil Wayne

Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it

Wet your ass up head to feet 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter, tell the gardener cut the grass

Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass

Yo, I'm in Atlanta, bruh
Hit me back, lil' nigga

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slept stupid
East side, Lil' Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here


[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy, you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
""Niggas ain't seein' you, Venus""—shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills—my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm peeping premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my deliverance
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine, nigga
Ha—now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

I was tryna maintain, look how far I done came
Pop champagne for the pain, I'm campaginin' for change
All the progress we made, bigger things on the way


[Verse 2: Killer Mike, Blxst & Both]
Hoppin' over hurdles into my Chevy converter (Yeah)
Swerve around them haters that don't wish to see me further (Oh)
My campaign for champagne could've ended with my murder
Miss Betty say, ""If you ain't saved in Jesus name, it's worser""
I had to be my own boss, not somebody else's worker
I know the prayer she prayed for me still served as my preserver
I know some of my actions, they was taxin' and I hurt her (Oh-oh-oh)
But Lord, if she listenin', please let her know I heard her (Yeah)

[Chorus: Blxst]
Let's bring out the champagne, roll up an airplane, life is a rare thing (Life is a rare thing)
We rise, we fall, even when back to wall, I find a way I can maintain, yeah
Treat MLK like my memory lane, ain't no feelin' the same, hope you feelin' my pain
I put my blood, sweat, and tears in the game, ain't no feelin' the same, hope you feelin' my pain",Weezy Baby,Lil Wayne

And you say, New York City!
Uh-huh
Put your hands together
Young!
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yes! (Yes!)

[Verse 1]
I'm from the '80s
Home of the her-on
Era of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custies
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer, Papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream, I'm living the life still
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, Army jacket lining
40 Below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige ""Reminisce"" on
I hear his voice in my mind like, ""Nigga, live on""
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high, nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
6's kitted up – man, I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the Hall of Fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came


[Bridge]
(Woo!) Uh-huh (Gyeah)
I want the sky, baby
I want the sky, baby

[Verse 2]
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me, Argentina – I mobbed the Bimmer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
""Billie Jean – the goddamn boy ain't mine""
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before, so
""Here we go"" – and I'm not Domino
When it ""All Falls Down,"" I'm like Kanye's jaw – I might break, but I don't fold
'Til I hold the sky in my hand – yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed as such
Here's to the man who refused to give up
I want the sky, nigga – chuuurch

You feel that? (If you're my down-ass bitch)
Yeah-yeah (Uh, yeah, down-ass bitch)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Big Rabbit)

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
No gold rings, this shit just my main squeeze
Coming to the crib, breaking down a set of keys
Back in the days, I admit, I had some issues (Yeah)
Took twelve on the chase, I jumped out, I crashed the rental
But you my down-ass bitch (Yeah)
The one that'd never fuck up or snitch
I fleed the scene, a hit and run, I left the Glock with the switch
Police gon' press you, we got lawyers, baby, don't tell 'em shit (Don't say shit)
And I be rock-rock-rockin' 'til the cops come knockin' at my
College girl, got her stressin', she got a jail record (Damn)
I put the Range in her name and I'm fuckin' up her credit
The judge gave her probation, he had knots in her stomach
After the case, she wiped her Instagram and changed her number (The fuck?)
Damn, bitch, thought we was gang, I would've killed for her
Ex nigga got you engaged, that nigga kneeled for her (You running with this nigga?)
Heartbreak most thug niggas ain't built for it
Tears steady droppin' 'til the cops come knockin' at my

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
So many RNs I done made, waitresses I done saved
The blow drop-off for bitches who ain't learn to braid
Matured all the sorors and every AKA
Michelle's blueprint showed the error in their ways
All the rent I paid, you know I play it fair
Just leave an extra key so I can weigh it there
Bribe money so your boyfriend wouldn't lay up there
Dope game, I'm the ultimate create-a-player
2K21, Savage like 21
Fridays are draft night, you bitches is one-and-dones
I am the one of one, I am the summer son
I am the street dream, Nas with the cummerbund
Jewelry Supreme Team, anchors is done and hung
The dope floats on a boat, now come give the drummer some
They going for thirty-three, I just let the numbers run
The king of the kilo, I don't believe none of 'em

Tattoos that's some war wounds (Except Gibbs, war wounds)

Gibbs, where you at, man?
Usually, it's the world looking for me, I don't go looking for the world
I mean, I'm just saying
I just came from the Appalachian Mountains
I was up there chilling, smoking some weed with some Buddhist monks
We was having the bestest of times
Then all of a sudden my pager go off
And I gotta come straight down here to holler at you, Gibbs
And trust me, man, I am the way and the light
And speaking of lights, you got one?
'Cause I wanna light this bomb-ass Kush
Matter fact I'ma come by there with this Kush I got for you

And we just gon' have a whole feast right now

41st Side convention, Queens connection
The Bridge we reppin' any party that we step in
Get the Henny up, VSOP immediately
Extra bent, wildin' out, son, is evident
We stash cream, mansions fulfill my dream
Ice rings gleam, spread love throughout the whole team
Dominate the game, let's have a rule, combinations
No conversation, bring on your good confrontation
You hesitatin', ass bettin', that's bad business
For the game, nigga, get out the business
You waste of space, substitute, here's a replace
We deface, smack the smile off your fuckin' face
Taint the taste, send you home back to vacate
Get your shit together plus your mind straight

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo, my empire strikes with the strength of poisonous snakes
My entire unit loaded up with snake niggas that hire stakes
We pull off at high stakes
Great escapes, expand, shift team downstate
Dreams of growing old with my son to live great
Little man, I'm plannin' to enhance your mindstate
The rebirth, a nigga who lived an ill life
The one before me was a one even more trife
My understandin', I'll raise you with precise plannin'
And put you on to the whole game of this planet
But I gotta survive in order to follow through
Plans to live lotto, me and my little kicko
Any man tryna stop us, he get wet, though
You couldn't withstand the snake bite, there is no antidote
You put your hands too close and try to approach
I won't snap at you, I'm goin' for throats
And when you feel my bite, you sing high notes
I peeped you from deep and then you got cut close
My formulae, I live life do or die
Stare into the eyes of a deep wiseguy
Prodigy, turnin' niggas to protegés
My protegé, I advise your ass to make way, make way
For fully-auto gun spray
You're small prey, I'll easily bait and trap game
This man is half mad scientist, half sane
Create a rhyme labyrinth like poisonous cannabis
Here, take a toke of this deadly rare vocalist
Overpower y'all, tiny noise like locusts
Like sunlight through a magnifying glass, I'll focus and burn
A hole straight through your brain and leave you open (Oh, shit)
And let the venom soak in
You start sweatin' and goin' through convulsions from dope shit I writ
Leavin' niggas stuck, I let stick
Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick
I'll wrap you up, a cocoon, get caught up in the midst
A dangerous, it's risky business fuckin' with this
Contender number one, I put you on top of the list
You're the best challenger so far, I'll give you this
But peep this (What?), fatal shots to solar plex
Man down, now who dares to go next?
Like General Monk Monk, orders to chop necks
I send a message to my whole clique to bomb shit
Atomic, no time for calm shit
We hyperactive when it's time to Vietnam it
Your whole alliance gets singlehandedly bombed
Take heed to the apostle's warning

Bad Idea (feat. Chance the Rapper),Cordae,"76 ContributorsBad Idea Lyrics[Intro: Cordae]
Yeah, uh (Bongo ByTheWay)

[Verse 1: Cordae]
I know myself far too well to be a stranger of pain
Despite it all, we remainin' the same, I'm just changin' the game
Heart pure, never tainted with fame
Straight ahead, I'ma stay in my lane
Never switchin' courses, life's amazin', shit is gorgeous
Lookin' at the bigger picture, portrait, and I smile wide
Performed the song and the crowd cried
How can I lie? I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes
I know the shit you goin' through the last month
You stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt
A nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk
You can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch
Uh, ramen noodles on the regular
Add some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch
Peanut butter jelly and syrup sandwich, et cetera
And we just flyin' in the nebula

[Chorus: Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright


[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'
Finally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment
Out South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman
Roundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul
Confused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place
Some of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase
I know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm fireplace
I had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste
I promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates
They used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape
Do that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid
Don't ever think it's sweet, that's that crème de la brûlée
Who they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy
My wifey yellin', ""Who they?"" My daughter yellin', ""Hooray""
I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky
I keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye
Like a stye, uh

[Verse 3: Cordae]
So don't you shed a tear
'Cause there'll be better years
I live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear
God cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears
The feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
A young nigga, dog, but I done witnessed many things
Age thirteen, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans
You know they a lil' extra faded around the knees with the grass stains in 'em
I really wish a little extra cash came in 'em 'cause a nigga really needed it
Pain, I defeated it, and brought back
Soul survivor, nigga, what you call that?


[Chorus: Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & SiR]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright",Weezy Baby,Lil Wayne

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Listen, music my flesh and blood, it's been my only love since ye high
I used to play Jay high and Ye high
Thinkin' one day I would go from fan to fuckin' player
I guess I found a way huh, my nigga Cozz wants Zendaya
A side note, I'm rootin' for you, I use these bars and start recruitin' for you
But treat her right
And just remember, on your lonely nights this mic will be your friend
You tell it all your secrets that you keepin' deep within
Your fantasies, regrets, your happy moments and your sins
And if he doesn't comprehend, at least he can pretend
Let's begin to be the men we never seen
In the 80's they smoke crack but now today they sippin' lean
And poppin' Xannies
Fuck niggas runnin' from their families
The streets don't give a fuck about the Grammys
Wish I could talk to granny, wish I could smoke in peace
But when I hit the blunt lately my mind it tortures me
Everything ain't supposed to be, apparently
I take it as a sign and stick the shit that's steerin' me
In the direction of some clarity
This music is my therapy, I thank the Lord 'cause he care for me

Music is my soul and fuel
I guess it only saves a chosen few
From goin' to school or sellin' dope, crazy
Back in school, I was bumpin' Cole daily
Now I'm writin' rhymes in the notebook that Cole gave me
And bro you so crazy, but all I can do is thank you
You threw your boy a lob, and shit, I ain't even say to
But fuck it, all that shit he say true
'Cause you a dime, I'm sure you hear that every day, cool
So look, fuck bein' fine 'cause I know you got a brain too
And shit, let me not get my plate full, you know your brain moves
A little different when you haven't ate food
So I'ma leave it up to fate to make these decisions
And stick to my intentions
I did it for more of the passion, not the great checks
Knowin' that there's more than fat asses and great sex
Tryna be the man I ain't yet
But demons stuck on me like ashes on gray sweats
'Cause man I ain't made shit and I'm lackin' the patience
It's a battle to take in' the fact that I ain't win, yet
What am I sayin', I can't complain when
I travel and take trips, I look to God then I thank Him

Look, I'm still a student of the game but I been through some things
And I could school you at this age don't be clueless in the brain
You gotta learn to fly before you cruisin' with the planes
And you could be a boss, just gotta do it in your lane
Choosin' and choose to pray instead of choosin' prey
To use and abuse for pay
You doin' it for the love or you doin' it to get praised?
What would you do for fame?
If it was family or money, they probably lose you today
Probably go buy a car and try and coupe with the pain
Sometimes homies and hoes is truly the same
Try and screw you for change, yeah it's truly a shame
But somehow I seem to see the beauty in the rain

Ready or Not,Fugees,"151 ContributorsReady or Not LyricsThe Fugees' second biggest hit is an ominous warning to wack MCs. The song puts a hip-hop spin on a soul classic—its chorus and bridge are an interpolation of The Delfonics' 1968 hit “Ready or Not Here I Come… Read More [Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
Now that I escape, sleepwalk awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo, yo, yo, yo)


[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Eliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these styles I got, oh, baby
Hey, baby, 'cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh, baby
Hey, baby, you can't hide from the block, oh, no

[Verse 3: Pras, Pras & Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber (Drop bombs)
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)


[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (You know the—)

We used to be number ten, now we're permanent at one
In the battle, lost my finger, mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy, nah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jean
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George become Dead George
Stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade
That sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror

Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees
Hey, hey, hey, try to take the crew and we don't play-play
Say, say, say, like Paul McCartney, not hardly
Oddly enough, I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust

[Verse 1]
Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah!

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependent see
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me

But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth gettin' your face sliced
'Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?

Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!


[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?


[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!",The Rain Supa Dupa Fly,Missy Elliott

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate, then activate, the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a has-what""
That's one to live by, or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure – André
Got to her station, ""Here's my destination""
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower, kinda sour, 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit' it
But I'm witcha, 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway...
But anyhow, when in doubt
Went on out and bought it, 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
Sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote, and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned the crown,"" but until then

Ah ha, hush that fuss

Do you wanna bump and slump with us?

""Beep beep,"" then I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit, I
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins
I got no passion
I got no patience, and I hate waitin'

Nigga, it's the
Big Southern rap empresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these ma'fuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho's there out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But, nigga, if you hate now
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back as I fly to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Posted up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's sip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

Hey, yeah
I wanna shoop, baby (Shoop)
Ooh, how you doing, baby? (Shoop)
No, not you, you (Shoop)
The bow-legged one, haha, yeah, what’s your name? (Shoop)
Damn, baby, that sounds sexy, uh (Shoop)

[Verse 1: Pepa]
Here I go, here I go, here I go again (Again)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!) Okay then
Chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda, uh (Shoop)
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits (Shoop)
A ho, no, that don't make me
See what I want, slip-slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop-shoop-shoop (Shoop)

[Verse 2: Salt]
You're packed and you're stacked, 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (Thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?
If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang? (Shoop)
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha— well, uh (Shoop)
I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth Black skin with a smile (Shoop)
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum chocolate chip (Come on, come on)
Honey dip, can I get a scoop? (Please)
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna (Shoop)

Yo, Sandy, I wanna, like, taste you
Getcha, getcha lips wet cause it's time to have Pep (Shoop)

On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop
To the next man in the three-piece suit

But I'm wicked, G, (Yeah) hit skins but never quickly (That's right)

This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas
Northside, Southside, chunk ya deuce up
This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas
Eastside, Westside, chunk ya deuce up

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Plenty niggas get they head turned red for the bread
Start off with the information, load it up in ya head
Couldn't hold it, so it turned out its sumthin' he said
What he tell the FEDS (need someone to call)
Your decision was to snitchin' and they was there to listen
When he told what he know, said they barely was trippin'
Less time, now the niggas in a better position
Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin'
He was lookin at a 30 but he only did 10
How them years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and
He ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands
Will he make it out to make it, hmmm well it depends
Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends
Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen
Russian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin
You hear that, yea nigga thats the sound of revenge

[Hook 2: Chamillionaire]
Walk down the right road
'Cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow
Or you'll miss it
Listen to the G-Code

Then you'll keep yo mouth closed

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
If you gon live that crime life, I hope you hold dat 9 tight
You live life like a pussy then thats probably what you'll die like
I neva eva loved a sucka, them ain't really my type
Rats, snakes, yea mayne the game is full of wildlife
Don't wanna do no time right?
You wanna live that high life
Like go withdrawl, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight
Enter ya crib, see the clouds peepin' through ya skylight
You be a copycat, caught him right after my life, cause mine right
Thats what he told me but I didn't listen
Doin crime for a dime wasn't my intention
You insane, think his name sumthin' I will mention
Only snitches (need someone to tell)
Alotta niggas in the game, hustlin' doin they thing
Usin codes on the phone with unusual slang
If you know what he know then you won't say a thing
You wouldn't need someone to tell
Careful bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life
You plead, the streets will ignite ya T
Like you ain't got the right to breathe
(Cough) To choke on the realness
Reality is what the fake don't know how to deal with
Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it
Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with
Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with
But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it

This for the G's, street jugglin, movin the fire
When you talkin' what you talkin' it ain't through the wire
Police pull you over, now they callin' you a liar
You got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya
You don't know, you ain't sayin, you ain't heard what he said
Told you a closed mouth ain't gon neva get fed
A open mouth'll get you county instead of the FEDS
Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red
Niggas can't deal with no 9 to 5 so they day-to-day budgeters
Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers
You upstate, niggas use to be southerners
Here the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors
We the niggas thats too real to snitch on a snitch
But make a snitch turn to poof with a flick of the wrist
That ain't gon get in arguements, just go get you a clip
And they gon think about the consequences, let 'em repent

My life is real, baby
You peepin' me take a picture, you peepin' me take a picture
(You should take a photograph)
My life is real, baby
You peepin' me take a picture, you peepin' me take a picture
(You should take a photograph)
Catch me today with a Canon or a Kodak
'Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon' be a throwback
You see it's real (You see it's real), they be like, ""Look at that"" (Man)
Picture perfect, nigga, you should take a photograph

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Introducin' the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me, fool?
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you on TV mislead you
Don't let all the magazines and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistenin', you see the sedans we flippin'
The hundreds of grands we gettin', these units and scans we shippin'
You see that Caddy tippin', them thangs on that Caddy twistin'
That paint and that candy drippin', that drank and that can is missin' (What you mean?)
That ain't a cola, throat dry and you're feelin' sober
Boys tryin' to switch it over, apply it up in a soda (Soda)
Home of the Houston hustlers who grindin' to hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, get high when you sniff the odor
Huh, told ya you gotta have a foreign or buy a slab
Afford it then buy it, that's important without it now
Ain't gotta take college class to see that we 'bout our cash
You're not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab, hold up


[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
You see my slab (You see my slab), you see my candy slab (Slab)

Picture perfect, nigga, you should take a photograph

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Man, when I'm tippin', they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowin' glossy
The jealous will try to top me, but we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listenin' to ain't a floppy, that disc gon' be screwed and choppy (Screwed and chopped)
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift (Hold up)
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm poppin' up at Daytona on chrome and I'm poppin' trunk (Poppin' trunk)
Jammin' that ""Ridin' Dirty"" while riding beside the laws
And they starin' over at me tryna scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw, they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber 'cause
I'm tryna go wash the ride 'til them tires have whiter walls (Oh)
You peepin' them, take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smokin', then take a Swisher, there's plenty, just take 'em with ya
You chillin', you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hangin' with ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a handful and smile for the pictures, nigga


[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
You see my slab (You see my slab), you see my candy slab (Slab)
Picture perfect, nigga, you should take a photograph
You see my chick (You see my chick), you see my chick is bad (Bad)

You see it's real (You see it's real), they be like, ""Look at that"" (Man)

You see the bling up on my bracelet and the shine on my chest (Chest)
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja, no cess (Cess)
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
'Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess (Guess)
I'm the connection that you need when they say it's a drought (Drought)
'Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggas just out (Out)
And I'm the plug you gotta have when they say the river's dry (Why?)
'Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply ('Ply)
I'm too fly for the clouds (Clouds), too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses if you look at my clean ass (My clean ass)
Catch me today with a Canon or a Kodak (A Kodak)
'Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon' be a throwback
Candy still drippin', fours is still tippin'
Wood grain Grant steering wheel I'm still grippin'
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East (East)
And I'm repping for Pimp C

On the Grind,Paul Wall,"6 ContributorsOn The Grind Lyrics[Chorus: Paul Wall, Crys Wall & both]
I'm on the grind all day until the sun go down (Mh)
Puttin' paper in my pockets, grindin' all year 'round (Mh)
I'm on the block with the gangsters, stayin' ten toes down
I'm on the grind (I'm on my grind)
I'm on the grind all night 'til the sun come up (Yeah)
Countin' cash up in the cut, tryin' to make me a buck (Oh)
I'm making moves, stacking paper 'cause I'm handlin' all
I'm on the my grind
I'm on my grind
Check me out, baby (Mh)

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I got money on my mind, big Frank on my brain
Intoxicated by visions of chains and diamond rings
One thing here to obtain is fortune, forget the fame
Been ballin' since back in the game, been changin' the strings
These lames tend to complain, it's a goddamn shame
You think you flyer than a plane, but you washed up in the drain
Baby, pick the picture frame, it's all work no play
My hustle schedule is simply, all night, all day
I'm snappin' like paparazzi, I'm plottin' on Maserati
Been grindin' since lotty dotty, tryin' to earn that pay
Collectin' that green paper, I'm scheming and pulling capers
I'm giving these broads the vapers, from the fold to the tray
I'm on the grind

I'm on the grind all day until the sun go down (Mh)

I'm on the grind all night 'til the sun come up (Yeah)
Countin' cash up in the cut, tryin' to make me a buck (Oh)
I'm making moves, stacking paper 'cause I'm handlin' all
I'm on the my grind
I'm on my grind
Let me tell you a lil' bit 'bout myself

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
My hustle is Godzilla, my muscle is King Kong
My mind is Einstein, my flow is off the dome
My grind is dope feen, addicted to counting green
My money is Bill Gates, my ballin' is Yao Ming
I'm not impressed with bling, I'm more concerned with ching
Grinding since I was a teen, money over everything
See, I'm all about that paper stacks and bank rolls
The Lacs all fo's with drank cold and dank roll
Hustle is my hobby, inspired by Jonny Gotti, call me
Give me the wallet 'cause it's time to collect
VS up in the Johnny watch, shinin' so clear
The face look like a mirror, call it time to reflect
I'm on the grind


[Chorus: Paul Wall, Crys Wall & both]
I'm on the grind all day until the sun go down (Mh)
Puttin' paper in my pockets, grindin' all year 'round (Mh)
I'm on the block with the gangsters, stayin' ten toes down
I'm on the grind (I'm on my grind)
I'm on the grind all night 'til the sun come up (Yeah)
Countin' cash up in the cut, tryin' to make me a buck (Oh)
I'm making moves, stacking paper 'cause I'm handlin' all
I'm on the my grind
I'm on my grind

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Okay, uh
Heavyweight champ of the [?], people's champ in the building
People love to have to do it again, so cherish the moment
I stand with the soldiers, but I'm the saw and you compare me to no one
Prepare for atonement
I'm through with takin' food from the bargain
On my grind like brakes to them bad rotors
This your last notice, keep it rollin' and get it poppin'
I take twelve houses, gettin' 'em poppin' like it's The Carter from like Rich Porter
Aaron Jones in the form of flowin'
You should grind harder, matter of fact grind smarter
You need to map it out, so you can get where you goin'
I got where I'm at by planning how to get where I'm goin'
And if a nigga ever try to approach us, we sparked it out, think
Y'all rappers are actors, we tyrants and pirates
Take your niggas to the plank, walk it out, drink
Atlantic Ocean punch, freeze another lunch
Grind all day until the sun darken out, hey
Y'all niggas take breaks, we goin' all out
And we ridin' the car out 'til it conked out
Then we cop up some more cars, we rap stars
It's the Roc, we birth niggas, then rock niggas
Lay a nigga down in his own house, then ride off
I'm connected, I pop off, then hide out (Yeah)
Down in Houston with Paul Wall, y'all all soft
Like my Gucci leather, y'all never [?]
I'm like look who's here, [?] I'm on my grind forever",Rain,Chamillionaire
Hatin’ Me,Z-Ro,"3 ContributorsHatin’ Me Lyrics(*talking*)
Say Q, man feel this here, I don't know why
These motherfuckers be hating us the way they do
Every motherfucking day, all motherfucking day long
Nigga can't get no motherfucking rest, that's why
I drink and smoke so motherfucking much
You feel me, get off my dick

[Hook]
Why you be hating me
Day and night, baby
Mad at me, cause I don't buy
The dreams that you selling lately

[Z-Ro]
I needed to get up off my rump, and stack something
I was tired of walking around, ready to plack something
Big heads, screwdrivers, spark plugs to break the glass
Hold my bases of selling dope, anything to get that cash
I was getting grown faster, than average niggas
Bills and mouths to feed, I needed cabbage nigga
Did a little rapping on the side, but I was full time grind
Till they ran up and 50 one eleven, and shut it down
When I got out, I wanted to get some work and do it over
Instead I picked up a pen, and got to jotting in a folder
Niggas was bobbing they head, bitches was bobbing they head
The first time in my life, I didn't worry bout no feds
But I wasn't out the woods yet, round shife too
Niggas be killing eachother over lime light fool
Ain't with it fuck a million, I just want what I earn
But they don't like it when I holler KMJ because it burn


[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
If you wanna jam, you can grab a hold of my funk
But if you plan to take me off of my game, like I'm a chump
I won't punk about it, I'mma do my thang
Dumping on niggas from the turning lane
But it's burning man, cause that's how it go down
Niggas be trying to get you, when you live in H-Town
And you throwed, in the game
Wanna get you for your mouthpiece or your name
Have you giving up hits, having no change
Having more overdue bills, no strings
Not me, no more, it's a new day
I'm in a new ride, and it's looking too gray
Remember if you sew it, it'll read right back
So when you treat a nigga wrong, the heavens'll handle that

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Got a name for myself now, selling them tapes
I still be traveling I-10, but I ain't selling no weight
No more, blue over gray four do', in and out the lanes
Steady keeping my melodies, running in and out your brain
But I need my money, cause ain't no working for free
If it ain't twenty-five hundred, no appearances from the Z
Man, got to get my feet man, got to be treated fair
Trying to put me on a back burner, I'm out of there
A veteran to the game, you can't do me like no ho
When my crib got flooded, you didn't help me you let me float
Now you wanna exercise your contractual right
But if you fuck me the first time, there ain't gon be a twice
Recognize ain't no hate in my heart, cause I'm a guard
I don't hate nobody, just hate it when times get hard
In my new situation, I'm having rich-nigga troubles
Without the switch, I'd have in a ditch-nigga troubles

Time,Z-Ro,"3 ContributorsTime Lyrics“Time” is Z-Ro’s reflection on his time spent incarcerated. It is deeply spiritual and steeped with the hard-learned lessons of a humbled man.

Verse 1 are his reflections while in jail and verse 2 is his… Read More [Verse 1]
Thank the Lord for my fans cause they love Z-Ro
I get mail but ain't no letters from nobody I know
It's like I've been forgotten ever since I got locked down
But when my feet hit the ground, that's when phony homies come back around
I'm talkin fair weather friends
That kick it with you when the sun shines on you, but when the fair weather ends
It's over
Nobody screamin free Z-Ro like Bun B was screamin' Free Pimp C
Except Flipperachi and Pimp C
But I'm still livin' and still pimpin' my pen
I swear I'm surrounded by women most offenders ain't men
They gossip like they sittin in the beauty shop
Can't own nothin too busy criticizin what the next man got
And all I hear is, ""I ain't gon' sack no groceries or work at fast food""
I would sweep the floor at MacDonalds if I had to
Fuck pride homie I'm tryna raise my daughter
Hopin' I make parole so I can work on bein' a father
Another birthday came and went still wearin' white
I try to sleep all day long, so I can write all night
No visits no rec the only time I get to leave my cell is at chow times and showers
Minutes feel as if they're hours
I read books, tryna put some fat on my head
Dreamin' about when I get back on my bread
So many people want me to fall I know they'd love to see me on lock
But in a minute-I'll be back on top-in due time


[Hook]
Time waits for no one
Last year was a hard one but life goes on
I bump my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
I fall off every ten minutes on this mission I'm on
Time waits for no one
Last year was a hard one but life goes on
I never said I was perfect, man I come from the block
If it wasn't for time, I'd be stuck in the same spot

[Verse 2]
I can breathe again-pass me a blunt that's fat
Plus my strap, so I can face my enemies again
July 9th, ain't no more commissary - catch me at Pappadeux
Time to get tapered by free world clippers and shop clothes
Plus I gotta leave certain people alone
That could determine if I go back to prison or stay at home
Bottom line: you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
It ain't like it's hard to tell-I've reentered the game
Ain't nothin changed except the year
When I left we were dyin' and death is still here
As if we feel nothin' man enough to kill somethin
But too coward to come together and build somethin
Violent crimes, the caskets are smaller in size
How the hell a ten year old get shot-eleven times?
Prison ain't changed me, I'm the same nigga
Not a trouble maker but ya'll know I'll never hesitate to pull-a-trigger
They say my ghetto instrumental is influential to blacks
I just confess how far I go, not to get put on my back
I never made a man kill a man
Even if he was bumpin' my song at the time-murder was his original plan
I understand it's a time to be born and a time to die
A time to laugh and a time to cry
A time to look for somethin' and a time to consider it lost
Time for sadness and a time for joy
A time to build and a time to destroy
A time for war and peace
A time for silence and a time to speak
And I think it's time we come together on these streets
Fill up churches Sunday mornin' like clubs-Saturday nights
And have a good worship service just like we have a good fight
Cause when the trumpet blows it's over, time is at it's end
If you don't wanna burn, forever repent for all of you're sins
And homie I don't give a fuck, if you blood or cuz
Get you're relationship right with the one above
Cause it's almost time.....

Man calm down shorty
(Nah you calm down, I ain't got shit to say to you man)
Man see that's why I don't even fuck wit'chu dawg
(Hollywood ass nigga, I don't fuck with YOU)
You be on that bullshit man

Should respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Won't accept nuttin' else so respect this hustle
I ain't in it for the fame, I ain't in it for the glory
I'm down to die for it, absolutely mandatory
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Won't accept nuttin else so respect this hustle - AY!

[Verse 1]
These niggas bitch-made, I'm gettin' paid six ways
Six laid, shit's sprayed, lemonade with blades
Keep your mouth closed, you don't wanna get sprayed
Shoot you up your body, let it sunbathe six days
Kamikaze renegade, nah, he never been afraid
Kept the trap hot enough to fry an egg in the shade
I ball 'til the day I'm lyin' dead in the grave
I leave the Feds behind the wall 'cause I ain't get away
Chopper round the corner and a bushel with a brick of yay
A bust can happen any day, we out here trappin' anyway
Gettin' money's an addiction, damn, what a nigga say?
I got a real bad condition if I ain't gettin' paid
Hand over fist, well, I miss it, gotta get busy
I know you see this car I drive and see the house that I live in
And figure this is enough (what, nigga?), I want way mo'
Nigga, this is Play-Doh, you set your sights way low
Had enough of the game, I don't know whether to stay or go
And different group of lames and suckas e'rywhere which way I go
(But, nigga, know you King, why you always gotta say it fo'?)
'Cause they said I couldn't say it befo'
And I remember all it did was fuck my temper up mo', Doug and J know
I said I wear a crown, not a halo - sorry
Niggas think they seein' me, but they so sorry
They fast, but they ain't no Ferrari {*YOOM!*}


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ay, don't you think you been pullin' gats, fussin', cussin' enough?
Round here, braggin' 'bout these niggas you be bustin' enough?
Man, look around, ain't nobody sufferin' but us
You could beat a hundred cases, catch one, and you fucked
(Man, I get probation) Is you crazy? Pull a gun in the club
See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
If we gotta come with a slug, why we come to the club?
How much more of this shit you think we can sweep under the rug?
(Look, we already told them ""I Told You So"")
But all these niggas speakin' out who wouldn't spoke befo'
Don't take it personal, people wanna be close to folk
What you think the televisions and the posters fo'?
(Yeah, man, I'm claustrophobic though) Well, you need to see a doctor for it
And I ain't jokin', you close, Tip and you 'bout to blow it
Did you forgot about them nights in the cells, was you honest?
(I dunno) When we was havin' talks with God and you promised
If he made a way for you to be large, and you done it
Out the gate, ""Urban Legend"" went on to do numbers
Sold a mil', made ""ATL"", ""King"", first week five hundred
Won the Grammy's (but not the one that I wanted)
What about them eight figure deals and that other new money?
But ask yourself somethin', where the gun you got from me?
Keep it real


Talk about somethin' other than yourself sometime (man)
Did you keep your promise partner? (Ay, just keep it real)

Ayy, shawty, bust it open for me, let me see you get loose

Bend it over, reach for yo' toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My potnas in the club and we chillin' to the max
Poppin' bottles, blowin' money, we ain't learn how to act
All in the V.I.P. spendin' four or five stacks
You can tell it's T.I.P. from how I bend my hat
Send the waitress to the bar but she comin' right back
Bet a shot of x-o'll get you on the right track
You got yo' girl with you, better hold her hand, I'm a mack on attack
Turn yo' head and she bound to get snatched
Give the dick to her once, get her hooked like crack
Takin' cum in the face, yeah, I like it like that
Holdin' on to her waist while I hit it from the back
If she come wit' Pussy Pumper she ain't never comin' back
Rough sex, talkin' dirty, yeah, she into all that
Got a movie that'll prove that what I'm sayin' is all fact
Bra and panties all black and some real tall stacks
Suckin' titties, eatin' cat, shot her off the meat rack

Let me see you drop it down, get that eagle on, girl
Ain't no fuckin' way I'm leavin' here alone, girl
Money ain't a thang to the uncut 'caine
Baby, I can make a mill' if I rap or if I sing
Done tryin' to ball, ma, I own a damn team
Even with a noose nigga still can't hang
Let me tell you who I'm is
Lunatic, man, straight up out the heartland
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand
In different colors, man, worth a couple-hundred grand
Damn, mama, how you do that there?
How yo' waist stay still, but you move that there?
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there
Check it, okay, let's have some fun
I got four G's and five five G's in one

[Verse 3: T.I.]
You ready to get loose
Shawty better be sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo' feet on the concrete merrily
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'ma let her be
Why should I let that worry me? Too many bitches cherish me
Pimp 'til I die, be a player 'til they bury me
Renegade, I'ma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches any day
Slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex
Got yo' girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X
Havin' *Pussy Pumper*, so all them expect
The best sex, and that's what all of them get

Ayy, shawty, bust it open for me, let me see you get loose

You know I like to scramble mine, Waffle House style
Or leave 'em sunny side up and let 'em chill for a while
Not only have I done it, I did it, I lived it
Delivered it myself, yeah I'm making house visits
I'm praying while I'm driving, it's making me religious
In the head lights behind me, it's making me suspicious
And maybe I'm trippin', and maybe I'm not
Maybe it's nothing, just hope it ain't the cops, OK

And then I flip that, then send that right back
If it got 2 BANDS, it must be 5 stacks
So you owe 5 stacks, bring that right back
If it take too long, must be rerock
2 in the shoebox, nah these ain't Reeboks
I don't live there, I just cook there
Ain't nothing in there, but fish and cookware
Can't drop for shit, work that fork though
Lock up like whoa, Young like fo' sho
This shit right here, call that Come Back
Drop this 9 off, and I'll be right back

They talk bricks, see, I'm just listening, yawn
Say, I'm just listening (Yeah!)
Hook might be tight, but that don't sound right
I sold Snow White and he sold no white

[Intro]
Yeah, I see you, big bro
I'ma kill these niggas, man
Yeah, haha

[Verse 1]
Straight off the block with it (Block with it)
Eagle Street, to be specific (Specific)
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference (Keep the difference)
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racin', I'm just sprintin'
'Cause I don't wanna finish (Wanna finish)
They diminish, I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world, ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30 (12:30)
​​​a.m., weigh them, if they short, take them
Right back and spray him, amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thing
Yeah, believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see, I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em 'til some fell
I'm just repel 'em, I'ma kill 'em, someone tell 'em I'ma kill 'em
I'ma fill 'em up, his mama can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'ma kill 'em and, yeah, we sell 'em, I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki' go for twenty, half a ki' go for eleven
After me there, will be nothing
I am legend and I Will Smith
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

Heh, c'mon, just a snare and a 808
Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A. 
Okay, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle from giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350, tank never empty
Damn, everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy, was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'ma take it one-two, way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool, as I blew by you
Hello, hi, you, I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you, feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing, I show and prove and show improvement
And I know just to go into it, could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you wanna do it, we can do it like we late
Ayy, wait, Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch


[Chorus]
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch

Damn, I'ma get in a nigga chest like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fucking ram
On the hunt for the lamb, I'ma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam, hair nappy like Pam
Nigga, fuck your plan, fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man and fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh, goddamn, there's my sample
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared, suck my dick
With red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos
And I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat, bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church!"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
'Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush 'em and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
'Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, 'cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear

Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!


[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine

At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve

Look, young desperado, straight out the grotto
I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga, but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought, ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga, I've been gettin' my share in like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets, check my bio
I started high with two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts; cashews
But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away, like, ""Later dudes""
Never get caught, baby, I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me, nigga, I'm a dog; no Asian food
I wet up the party, so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes, you bitch ass nigga

My nigga, keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit

And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit

You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't you forget, I know ya, you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that, fall back

Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the blinky, splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothin' to Crack
Lay the murder game down, back to hustlin' packs
Yeah, Weezy homie's got your back, whether raps or macks
Either way, they both spit like, ""Blrrat!""
Nigga, them motherfuckers is broke like them levees
And we done sold so much dope, ain't shit you tell me, nigga
How you want it, huh? Coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you runnin' naked like in Old School
And, yeah, we 'bout it, 'bout it, and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider, homie, and you can find it on me
That .40 cal'll get your shirt picture ironed on it
Haha, this shit is funny to me
All these niggas wantin' war, but they runnin' from me, crack!

Changed all my new shoes, nigga, got some new tools, nigga
Got some more jewels, we was gettin' money

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets

Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, what’s understood ain’t got to be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Heh, stood in the heat, the flame
The snow, ""Please, slow down, hurricane""
The wind blow, my dreads swang
""He had hair like wool, like Wayne""
Huh, dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out, and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy
All real, very extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, or whenever, and the F for...

Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'? If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


[Spoken: Lil Wayne]

I'm watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout Black guys. Talking about how young Black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only... I don't want to say only right, but, shit... only logic by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found—you know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; Level 3, Level 4 drugs, shit like that.

Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood, huh? Yeah.

You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared. I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the Level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track. That's the good weed.

You know what? I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him? Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender. Hahaha. Then give me a paper. Haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.

Another thing. Let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh... Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.
Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.

Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um...

Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you: You don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!

But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. But I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.


You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him

Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

Most of these ducks exaggerate
But, I'ma get money nigga
Everyday stuntin' nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me
Bitch I'm ballin'

And, I'ma throw this money
While you do it wit no hands

Shoot Me Down,Lil Wayne Feat. D. Smith,"83 ContributorsShoot Me Down LyricsWayne asks his enemies not to shoot him down from his throne in hip-hop, while at the same time declaring he has no competition and that you couldn’t even hit him if you tried[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Open up your hearts, people
Page one, chapter one, verse motherfucking one
Yeah, uh-huh
I'm drinking hot tea, bitch
Feel me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, now if you let me, you won't regret me
Shit, if you let me, you won't forget me
Remember? And if you don't then ponder
Hold up, bow! bow! there's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna
I sweat money, and the bank is my shower
Haha, and that pistol is my towel
Haha, so stop sweating me, coward
And I would die for ours
Ride for hours, supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it

[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now
So am I, yeah, yeah


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home
No more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket
Bitch, I'm grown, fuck what you on
Now, watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump, I'ma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see, I am nothing like you, why?
Bitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the stars, then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'll get you, my picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of ""Definition""
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son, I know your barrel burnin', but—

[Chorus: D. Smith]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Ayy, I'ma talk to my daddy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Papa, I did it to 'em! I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again, like ""nigga"" backwards
These niggas backwards, but they behind us
Now, watch me get high, like, time's up
Nah, D., bring the drums back
And watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that
I get respect 'cause if I don't, I'ma take it
I see your boys hating, and I see your girls naked
Drum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb
Then, I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aiming at a mirror


[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Watch me soar
Where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher",3 Peat,Lil Wayne

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could (Me, too)
Buy me a spaceship and fly (I swear I do)
Past the sky, oh
GLC feel you, Ye—I feel you, man
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky (Man, man, man...)
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

Past the sky
Tryna tell you, man, way past the sky
Oh, oh (Let's go, ugh)

[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently, I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd You have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!

Aww, man, this pressure
And I ain't made shit

And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly

I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn they back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit

We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases

Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)

It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't be regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree ?)

[Jay-Z]
I invented swag, poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
#proof ""I guess I got my swagger back"" #truth
New watch alert #Hublot
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snapback, see my cut through the holes

[Kanye West]
Damn Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been ?
Niggas talking real reckless #stuntmen
I adopted these niggas #Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain


[Jay-Z]
Photoshoot fresh, looking like wealth
I’m 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450, I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I’m never going to jail

[Kanye West]
I made Jesus Walks, so I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, han ?
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I’m done I'll hit you up maña...nah

Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubana’s with Castro in cabanas

Can’t you see we gettin money up under you ?

Can’t you see the private jets flying over you ?

[Intro: Bon Iver]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker – now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example:

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit them with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gonna do now?
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now""
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill the block, I murder the avenues
I rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She's on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stands besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give them whiplash
I think big, get cash, make them blink fast
Now look at what you just saw
This is what you live for
I'm a motherfucking monster


[Outro: Bon Iver]
I crossed the line
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows

What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic, I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats, preach

I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

Coke on her black skin
Made a stripe like a zebra, I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil, last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m., I wonder if they got cabs still?
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepherd
Two tattoos: one read ""No Apologies""
The other said ""Love is Cursed by Monogamy""
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap: preach

Lift up your head and keep movin' (Keep movin'), turn the mic up

Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty—wait, listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been usin' it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more

Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’ussé with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Halftime,Nas,"240 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsРусскийHalftime Lyrics[Produced by Large Professor]

[Intro]
(Right... Right...)
Check me out, y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'ma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

[Chorus]
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel


[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise 'cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime


[Chorus]
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out


[Outro]
(Right...) It's still halftime
(Right...) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right...) '92, it's halftime
(Right...) Yo, police, police man, yo, let's get ghost

Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination madе my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to gеt the dough off
Stickin' up white boys on ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-tight clique and went all out
Catchin' ki's from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPVs, every week we made forty G
Yo, brothas, respect mine or here go the TEC-9, ch-pow
Move from the gate now


[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin'
But I'm alive on arrival, I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause **** deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed, I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not touch (Touch)
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask, what's it worth?
Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young Black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


[Chorus: Method Man & Inspectah Deck]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all (Do what they gotta do to get through, know what I'm sayin'?)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. (Because you can't just get by no more)

So, what's up, man?
Coolin', man
Chillin', chillin'?
Yo, you know I had to call, you know why, right?
Why?
Because, yo, I never, ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?
Yeah
You know what I wanna hear, right?
What you wanna hear?
I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint
Wu-Tang again?
Ah, yeah, again and again

Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Protect your neck, kid)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (First to set it off)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (The Inspectah Deck)

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic' like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier
The hellraiser, raisin' Hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So, uh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the **** that I'm kickin'
The lone ranger
Code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art
To rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin', ""Goodbye,"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck
Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel
I make more noise than heavy metal


[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, yo, flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh'

[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short, Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left
Uh, and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like fame, my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over like they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a, ""Soo?""
'Nough respect due to the 1-6-ooh
I mean, ""Oh""
Yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson
Or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical bud make me—


[Bridge: U-God]
Ooh
What? Grab my nut, get screwed
Ow
Here comes my Shaolin style
True
B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the, ""Soo""

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard & RZA]

Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Come on, baby, baby, come on, baby, baby, come on, baby, baby, come on)
Watch your step, kid (Protect your neck)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Yo, you best protect your neck)

[Verse 4: Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first, man, you're **** with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a **** nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat, rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down, now **** is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin', Ason Unique
Rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your **** ass


[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with **** in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is
You're **** with pros
And there it goes

[Verse 6: RZA]
Yo, chill with the feedback, Black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the **** your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buckest
Style, the ruckus
Ten-times-ten, men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your **** chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
He'll be comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My Clan increase like Black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare
Ge-Gecka-Genius, take us the **** out of here

[Verse 7: GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these cold killer labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now, that thought is just as bright as a twenty-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy, they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

[Interlude]
Huh, huh
Huh
Huh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Outro: RZA & Ol' Dirty Bastard]

Ms. Fat Booty,Mos Def,"118 ContributorsMs. Fat Booty Lyrics[Hook]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

[Intro]
Man, duke, I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man...
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[Verse 1]
Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame! She like cats with big thangs –
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the 6 Range
I seen her on the ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance, with the fat booty pants – hot damn!
""What's your name, love? Where you came from?""
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica –
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up


Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Aiyyo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (""Say word!"")
Yo, it's the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (""Yeah, that's her"")
Shocked as hell, she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
""How you feelin'?"" ""Oh, I'm fine,"" ""My name is Mos,"" ""I'm Sharice""
""I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet""
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance wit' me?""

[Chorus]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget


[Interlude]
She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, ""Word?!""
I played it low though
I was like, ""Yeah, aight, come on then, let's go...""
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just...
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond – to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me...

[Verse 2]
""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But, baby, you know what it's like –
Some brothers don't be comin' right""
""I understand, I'm feelin' you –
Besides, 'Can I have a dance?' ain't really that original""
We laughed about it, traipsed her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished, and she whisper, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""

Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singing Gregory Isaacs
Like – ""If I don't, if I don't have you...""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man – I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O. – ""Come now,"" I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, ""Sweetheart, I got to have it""
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic – gahdamn it!
My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My ""911""'s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, ""I saw Sharice at the Kitty Club
With some bangin' ass Asian, playin' 'lay it down and lick me up'""
""What?!!""


[Outro]
Can you believe that shit, dude?
G, I was like... ""what???""
Ohhh, man, I was so sick, I was sooo sick, yo
I ha--I had no idea, that shit caught me like, ""Baow!""
Fucked up in the game, man – I was really feeling shorty...",N.Y. State of Mind,Nas

Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""boom-boom"" and your guns go ""pow-pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques, I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is born, I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!

Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti (You don't know?), you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed, to tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, big fella, put it on and on!

Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I'll see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair, Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L, you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My raps is steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club, you would not pay

Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talkin' 'bout you, yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Starin' at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the Ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun, you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that


[Verse 5: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed, Phife, and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ, and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

[Chorus: Nas]
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Rock on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues (What the fuck?)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the Uptown hot block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said, ""Pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process (Mm)
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, haha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88, what?


[Chorus: Nas]
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah, know what?
I'll make, you and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, advance
You're coppin' me like white crystal
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant (Uh)
I'll tell you half the story, the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life, man, pounds and pence
'Nough dollars make sense
While you ride the bench, catch me swingin' for the fence
Dead presidents, ya know? Uh-huh


[Bridge: Nas]
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Chorus: Nas]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Haha, yeah (Haha) yeah, so be it
The Soviet, the Unified steady flow
You already know, you light, I'm heavy, roll heavy dough
Mic-macheted your flow
Your paper falls slow like confetti, mine's a steady grow, perico
Pay 580 for blow, better believe I have 1160 to show
My dough flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the icon, baby, you like Dom?
Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners
Heavy spinners like hit records, Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected, this shit is perfected
From chips to chicks to strippin' in Lexus
Naked without your gun, we takin' everything you brung
We cakin', you niggas is fakin', we gettin' it done
Crime family, well-connected, Jay-Z
And you fake thugs is unplugged like MTV
I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure
Dead presidentials, politics as usual—Blaow!

Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Heh, okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect, have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word


[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all

Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer And me, the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Aiyo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point, Tip? All the time, Phife
You on point, Tip? Yeah, all the time, Phife
You on point, Tip? Yo, all the time, Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Okay, if knowledge is the key, then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent Black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper, what you say, Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that, then stop

[Intro]
Break 'em
Shit
Ah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (What's up?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)


[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.​
Today was a good day (Shit)

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun (Yeah)
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out (Uh)
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day (Shit)
